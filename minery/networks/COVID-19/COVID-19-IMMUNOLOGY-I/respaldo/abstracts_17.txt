36423071 | Allelic Variants of HLA-C Upstream Region, PSORS1C3, MICA, TNFA and Genes Involved in Epidermal Homeostasis and Barrier Function Influence the Clinical Response to Anti-IL-12/IL-23 Treatment of Patients with Psoriasis. Several biologic therapies have been developed to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with patients exhibiting different clinical benefits, possibly due to the heterogeneity of pathogenic processes underlying their conditions. Ustekinumab targets the IL-12/IL-23-p40 subunit and inhibits type-1 and type-17 T-cell responses. Although ustekinumab is effective as both short- and long-term treatment, therapeutic response varies considerably among patients. Ustekinumab biosimilars will be commercialized in the very next future, likely broadening the use of this drug in the treatment of psoriasis patients. Our pharmacogenomic study evaluated the influence of 417 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in psoriasis-risk alleles on the clinical response to ustekinumab in a cohort of 152 patients affected by moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis. Differences in SNP pattern characterizing HLA-Cw6+ or HLA-Cw6- patients, showing high or low responses to ustekinumab, were also analysed. We identified twelve SNPs in HLA-C upstream region (rs12189871, rs4406273, rs9348862 and rs9368670), PSORS1C3 (rs1265181), MICA (rs2523497), LCE3A-B intergenic region (rs12030223, rs6701730), CDSN (rs1042127, rs4713436), CCHCR1 (rs2073719) and in TNFA (rs1800610) genes associated with excellent response to ustekinumab. We also found that HLA-Cw6+ and HLA-Cw6- patients carried out distinct patterns of SNPs associated with different clinical responses. The assessment of HLA-C alleles, together with other genetic variants, could be helpful for defining patients who better benefit from anti-IL-12/IL-23 therapy.
36977960 | Leveraging Prior Healthy Participant Pharmacokinetic Data to Evaluate the Impact of Renal and Hepatic Impairment on Ritlecitinib Pharmacokinetics. Ritlecitinib is a selective, covalent, irreversible inhibitor of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) and the tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) family kinases. Pharmacokinetics and safety of ritlecitinib in participants with hepatic (Study 1) or renal (Study 2) impairment were to be characterized from two phase I studies. Due to a study pause caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study 2 healthy participant (HP) cohort was not recruited; however, the demography of the severe renal impairment cohort closely matched the study 1 HP cohort. We present results from each study and two innovative approaches to utilizing available HP data as reference data for study 2: a statistical approach using analysis of variance and an in silico simulation of an HP cohort created using a population pharmacokinetics (POPPK) model derived from several ritlecitinib studies. For study 1, the observed area under the curve for 24-h dosing interval and maximum plasma concentration for HPs and their observed geometric mean ratios (participants with moderate hepatic impairment vs HPs) were within 90% prediction intervals from the POPPK simulation-based approach, thereby validating the latter approach. When applied to study 2, both the statistical and POPPK simulation approaches demonstrated that patients with renal impairment would not require ritlecitinib dose modification. In both phase I studies, ritlecitinib was generally safe and well tolerated. These analyses represent a new methodology for generating reference HP cohorts in special population studies for drugs in development with well-characterized pharmacokinetics in HPs and adequate POPPK models.

37010651 | Bridging pre-surgical endocrine therapy for breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: outcomes from the B-MaP-C study. PURPOSE: The B-MaP-C study investigated changes to breast cancer care that were necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we present a follow-up analysis of those patients commenced on bridging endocrine therapy (BrET), whilst they were awaiting surgery due to reprioritisation of resources. METHODS: This multicentre, multinational cohort study recruited 6045 patients from the UK, Spain and Portugal during the peak pandemic period (Feb-July 2020). Patients on BrET were followed up to investigate the duration of, and response to, BrET. This included changes in tumour size to reflect downstaging potential, and changes in cellular proliferation (Ki67), as a marker of prognosis. RESULTS: 1094 patients were prescribed BrET, over a median period of 53 days (IQR 32-81 days). The majority of patients (95.6%) had strong ER expression (Allred score 7-8/8). Very few patients required expedited surgery, due to lack of response (1.2%) or due to lack of tolerance/compliance (0.8%). There were small reductions in median tumour size after 3 months' treatment duration; median of 4 mm [IQR - 20, 4]. In a small subset of patients (n = 47), a drop in cellular proliferation (Ki67) occurred in 26 patients (55%), from high (Ki67 >= 10%) to low (< 10%), with at least one month's duration of BrET. DISCUSSION: This study describes real-world usage of pre-operative endocrine therapy as necessitated by the pandemic. BrET was found to be tolerable and safe. The data support short-term (<= 3 months) usage of pre-operative endocrine therapy. Longer-term use should be investigated in future trials.
37062298 | Efficacy and safety of ritlecitinib in adults and adolescents with alopecia areata: a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 2b-3 trial. BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata is characterised by non-scarring loss of scalp, face, or body hair. We investigated the efficacy and safety of ritlecitinib, an oral, selective dual JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor, in patients with alopecia areata. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 2b-3 trial done at 118 sites in 18 countries, patients aged 12 years and older with alopecia areata and at least 50% scalp hair loss were randomly assigned to oral ritlecitinib or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks, with or without a 4-week loading dose (50 mg, 30 mg, 10 mg, 200 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg, or 200 mg loading dose followed by 30 mg), followed by a 24-week extension period during which ritlecitinib groups continued their assigned doses and patients initially assigned to placebo switched to ritlecitinib 50 mg or 200 mg loading dose followed by 50 mg. Randomisation was done by use of an interactive response system and was stratified by baseline disease severity and age. The sponsor, patients, and investigators were masked to treatment, and all patients received the same number of tablets to maintain masking. The primary endpoint was Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score 20 or less at week 24. The primary endpoint was assessed in all assigned patients, regardless of whether they received treatment. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03732807. FINDINGS: Between Dec 3, 2018, and June 24, 2021, 1097 patients were screened and 718 were randomly assigned to receive ritlecitinib 200 mg + 50 mg (n=132), 200 mg + 30 mg (n=130), 50 mg (n=130), 30 mg (n=132), 10 mg (n=63), placebo to 50 mg (n=66), or placebo to 200 mg + 50 mg (n=65). 446 (62%) of 718 patients were female and 272 (38%) were male. 488 (68%) were White, 186 (26%) were Asian, and 27 (4%) were Black or African American. Of 718 patients randomly assigned, 104 patients discontinued treatment (34 withdrew, 19 adverse events [AEs], 12 physician decision, 12 lack of efficacy, 13 lost to follow up, five rolled over to long-term study transfer, four pregnancies, two protocol deviations, one declined to attend follow-up due to COVID-19, one attended last visit very late due to COVID-19, and one non-compliance). At week 24, 38 (31%) of 124 patients in the ritlecitinib 200 mg + 50 mg group, 27 (22%) of 121 patients in the 200 mg + 30 mg group, 29 (23%) of 124 patients in the 50 mg group, 17 (14%) of 119 patients in the 30 mg group, and two (2%) of 130 patients in the placebo group had a response based on SALT score 20 or less. The difference in response rate based on SALT score 20 or less between the placebo and the ritlecitinib 200 mg + 50 mg group was 29 1% (95% CI 21 2-37 9; p<0 0001), 20 8% (13 7-29 2; p<0 0001) for the 200 mg + 30 mg group, 21 9% (14 7-30 2; p<0 0001) for the 50 mg group, and 12 8% (6 7-20 4; p=0 0002) for the 30 mg group. Up to week 48 and including the follow-up period, AEs had been reported in 108 (82%) of 131 patients in the ritlecitinib 200 mg + 50 mg group, 105 (81%) of 129 patients in the 200 mg + 30 mg group, 110 (85%) of 130 patients in the 50 mg group, 106 (80%) of 132 patients in the 30 mg group, 47 (76%) of 62 patients in the 10 mg group, 54 (83%) of 65 patients placebo to ritlecitinib 200 mg + 50 mg in the extension period, and 57 (86%) of 66 patients in the placebo to 50 mg group. The incidence of each AE was similar between groups, and there were no deaths. INTERPRETATION: Ritlecitinib was effective and well tolerated in patients aged 12 years and older with alopecia areata. Ritlecitinib might be a suitable treatment option for alopecia areata in patients who are candidates for systemic therapy. FUNDING: Pfizer.
37267285 | Comparison of Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of Salmonella Isolates from Retail Meats in Nanchang, China, in Two Periods. Salmonella is one of the most important foodborne pathogens. In this article, a total of 160 Salmonella isolates recovered from retail meats in June-July 2018 (before COVID-19 outbreak) and December 2020-April 2021 (after COVID-19 outbreak) in Nanchang, China, were characterized for serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility, and specific resistance gene screening. The prevalence of Salmonella Typhimurium increased from 5.4% in 2018 to 19.1% in 2021, and Salmonella Enteritidis increased from 3.3% in 2018 to 8.8% in 2021. Compared with those in June-July 2018, Salmonella isolates in December 2020-April 2021 demonstrated a significant increase in resistance to 13 tested antibiotics except for doxycycline and nitrofurantoin (p < 0.05). The Salmonella isolates in December 2020-April 2021 showed a higher presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnrA, qnrB, and qnrS), and mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region (gyrA Asp87Asn, gyrA Asp87Tyr, parC Thr57Ser, and parC Ser80Ile). Whole-genome sequencing was used to analyze four polymyxin B-resistant strains. Some common mutation sites in eptC and micA were found in the four strains. Based on the data in this article, it indicated that antibiotic resistance was facilitated and more gene mutations related to quinolone resistance were developed.
37271218 | Clinical trait-specific genetic analysis in Behcet's disease identifies novel loci associated with ocular and neurological involvement. Behcet's disease is a complex inflammatory vasculitis with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetics underlying specific clinical features of Behcet's disease. A total of 436 patients with Behcet's disease from Turkey were studied. Genotyping was performed using the Infinium ImmunoArray-24 BeadChip. After imputation and quality control measures, logistic regressions adjusting for sex and the first five principal components were performed for each clinical trait using a case-case genetic analysis approach. A weighted genetic risk score was calculated for each clinical feature. Genetic association analyses of previously identified susceptibility loci in Behcet's disease revealed a genetic association between ocular lesions and HLA-B/MICA (rs116799036: OR = 1.85 [95% CI = 1.35-2.52], p-value = 1.1 x 10-4). The genetic risk score was significantly higher in Behcet's disease patients with ocular lesions compared to those without ocular involvement, which is explained by the genetic variation in the HLA region. New genetic loci predisposing to specific clinical features in Behcet's disease were suggested when genome-wide variants were evaluated. The most significant associations were observed in ocular involvement with SLCO4A1 (rs6062789: OR = 0.41 [95% CI = 0.30-0.58], p-value = 1.92 x 10-7), and neurological involvement with DDX60L (rs62334264: OR = 4.12 [95% CI 2.34 to 7.24], p-value = 8.85 x 10-7). Our results emphasize the role of genetic factors in predisposing to specific clinical manifestations in Behcet's disease, and might shed additional light into disease heterogeneity, pathogenesis, and variability of Behcet's disease presentation across populations.

38371309 | Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients receiving oral anticoagulants for the treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Background: Frequent monitoring of patients declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, harming patients with chronic diseases who critically needed correct monitoring. We evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) receiving treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in clinical practice in Spain. Methods: This observational, retrospective study analyzed prevalent patients treated with NOAC/VKA on 14/03/2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) and 14/03/2020 (COVID-19 period), who were followed up to 12 months. The study also considered incident patients who started treatment with NOAC/VKA between 15/03/2019 and 13/03/2020 (pre-COVID-19 period) and from 15/03/2020 to 13/03/2021 (COVID-19 period). Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, effectiveness, treatment patterns, and healthcare resource utilization were considered. Results: Prevalent patients amounted to 12,336 and 13,342 patients, whereas 1,612 and 1,602 incident patients were included in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. Prevalent patients treated with VKA had more strokes, thromboembolism, and major bleeding compared to those receiving NOAC, particularly during the COVID-19 period. NOAC patients had a 12 % lower risk of death than those on treatment with VKA (Hazard ratio = 0.88 [95 % CI: 0.81 - 0.95], p = 0.033). In addition, VKA patients were less persistent after 12 months than NOAC patients (pre-COVID-19 period: 52.1 % vs. 78.9 %, p < 0.001; COVID-19 period: 49.2 % vs. 80.3 %, p < 0.001), and required more healthcare visits and hospitalizations than those on treatment with NOAC. Conclusion: Compared to VKA, NOAC seems to have reduced the incidence of severe events and the use of healthcare resources for NVAF, particularly during the pandemic.
11581171 | Nuclear localization of the tyrosine kinase Itk and interaction of its SH3 domain with karyopherin alpha (Rch1alpha). We report a physical and functional association between the Tec-family tyrosine kinase Itk (Emt/Tsk) and the nuclear import chaperone karyopherin alpha (Rch1alpha) in human T cells. The Itk-SH3 domain and the Rch1alpha proline-rich (PR) motif were crucial for the Itk/Rch1alpha constitutive interaction as demonstrated by directed mutagenesis of the Rch1alpha PR motif (proline 242 to alanine, P242A). TCR-CD3 stimulation of Jurkat T cells resulted in increased Itk/Rch1alpha complex formation, recruitment of karyopherin beta to the protein complex and Rch1alpha tyrosine phosphorylation. Analysis of in vitro kinase reactions with a panel of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion tyrosine kinases (Itk, Lck, ZAP-70 and Jak3) revealed that only GST-Itk efficiently phosphorylated a recombinant GST-Rch1alpha fusion. We observed constitutive nuclear localization of Itk that was up-regulated following either TCR-CD3 stimulation or over-expression of wild-type Rch1alpha in T cells. Further, nuclear localization of Itk and TCR-CD3-mediated IL-2 production were significantly down-regulated following expression of the Rch1alpha-P242A mutant, implicating a role for Rch1alpha in the nuclear translocation of Itk.
15191522 | A psoriasis vulgaris protective gene maps close to the HLA-C locus on the EH18.2-extended haplotype. We determined the molecular haplotypes of the HLA-A, HLA-C and HLA-B loci and the MHC class I-B-related (MIB) microsatellite in 179 unrelated psoriatic patients (72 familial cases) and in 120 controls. The HLA-A*3002-Cw*0501-B*1801-MIB1 haplotype showed a strong negative association with psoriasis vulgaris (PV) and in particular with familial PV, revealing the presence of a PV-protective gene. Analysis of association and linkage disequilibrium of the single alleles and the various two-three-four-locus segments of this haplotype indicated the presence of a protective gene telomeric to the HLA-C locus. This finding was confirmed in 13 informative multiplex PV families, in which at least one parent carried the EH18.2 haplotype. In two families, an affected sibling presented HLA-A/C recombination on the EH18.2 haplotype. A study of 12 polymorphic microsatellites in all members of the informative families, 145 PV patients, 120 controls and 32 EH18.2 homozygous healthy individuals demonstrated that the protection conferred by the EH18.2 haplotype lies within a 170 kb interval between the C143 and C244 loci, most probably in a 60 kb segment between the C132 and C244 loci.
15331706 | Two African swine fever virus proteins derived from a common precursor exhibit different nucleocytoplasmic transport activities. African swine fever virus (ASFV), a large icosahedral deoxyvirus, is the causative agent of an economically relevant hemorrhagic disease that affects domestic pigs. The major purpose of the present study was to investigate the nuclear transport activities of the ASFV p37 and p14 proteins, which result from the proteolytic processing of a common precursor. Experiments were performed by using yeast-based nucleocytoplasmic transport assays and by analysis of the subcellular localization of different green fluorescent and Myc fusion proteins in mammalian cells. The results obtained both in yeast and mammalian cells clearly demonstrated that ASFV p14 protein is imported into the nucleus but not exported to the cytoplasm. The ability of p37 protein to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of both yeast and mammalian cells was also demonstrated, and the results clearly indicate that p37 nuclear export is dependent on the interaction of the protein with the CRM-1 receptor. In addition, p37 was shown to exhibit nuclear import activity in mammalian cells. The p37 protein nuclear import and export abilities described here constitute the first report of a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein encoded by the ASFV genome. Overall, the overlapping results obtained for green fluorescent protein fusions and Myc-tagged proteins undoubtedly demonstrate that ASFV p37 and p14 proteins exhibit nucleocytoplasmic transport activities. These findings are significant for understanding the role these proteins play in the replication cycle of ASFV.
15758205 | Reduced MIC gene repertoire variation in West African chimpanzees as compared to humans. The human major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) genes are members of a multicopy family showing similarity to the classical HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes. Only the MICA and MICB genes produce functional transcripts. In chimpanzees, however, only one MIC gene is expressed, showing an intermediate character, resulting from a deletion fusing the MICA and MICB gene segments together. The present population study illustrates that all chimpanzee haplotypes sampled possess the hybrid MICA/B gene. In contrast to the human situation this gene displays reduced allelic variation. The observed repertoire reduction of the chimpanzee MICA/B gene is in conformity with the severe repertoire condensation documented for Patr-B locus lineages, probably due to the close proximity of both genes.
15967992 | Genomic evolution of MHC class I region in primates. To elucidate the origins of the MHC-B-MHC-C pair and the MHC class I chain-related molecule (MIC)A-MICB pair, we sequenced an MHC class I genomic region of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus monkeys and analyzed the regions from an evolutionary stand-point, focusing first on LINE sequences that are paralogous within each of the first two species and orthologous between them. Because all the long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) sequences were fragmented and nonfunctional, they were suitable for conducting phylogenetic study and, in particular, for estimating evolutionary time. Our study has revealed that MHC-B and MHC-C duplicated 22.3 million years (Myr) ago, and the ape MICA and MICB duplicated 14.1 Myr ago. We then estimated the divergence time of the rhesus monkey by using other orthologous LINE sequences in the class I regions of the three primate species. The result indicates that rhesus monkeys, and possibly the Old World monkeys in general, diverged from humans 27-30 Myr ago. Interestingly, rhesus monkeys were found to have not the pair of MHC-B and MHC-C but many repeated genes similar to MHC-B. These results support our inference that MHC-B and MHC-C duplicated after the divergence between apes and Old World monkeys.
16415017 | Nuclear export of African swine fever virus p37 protein occurs through two distinct pathways and is mediated by three independent signals. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity of the African swine fever virus p37 protein, a major structural protein of this highly complex virus, has been recently reported. The systematic characterization of the nuclear export ability of this protein constituted the major purpose of the present study. We report that both the N- and C-terminal regions of p37 protein are actively exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of yeast and mammalian cells. Moreover, experiments using leptomycin B and small interfering RNAs targeting the CRM1 receptor have demonstrated that the export of p37 protein is mediated by both the CRM1-dependent and CRM1-independent nuclear export pathways. Two signals responsible for the CRM1-mediated nuclear export of p37 protein were identified at the N terminus of the protein, and an additional signal was identified at the C-terminal region, which mediates the CRM1-independent nuclear export. Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis revealed that hydrophobic amino acids are critical to the function of these three nuclear export signals. Overall, our results demonstrate that two distinct pathways contribute to the strong nuclear export of full-length p37 protein, which is mediated by three independent nuclear export signals. The existence of overlapping nuclear export mechanisms, together with our observation that p37 protein is localized in the nucleus at early stages of infection and exclusively in the cytoplasm at later stages, suggests that the nuclear transport ability of this protein may be critical to the African swine fever virus replication cycle.
16698448 | MICA, MICB, and MHC beta block matching in bone marrow transplantation: relevance to transplantation outcome. Genetic testing of the MHC is required for selection of donors for bone marrow transplantation. The outcome of related bone marrow transplantation is usually superior to that of unrelated bone marrow transplantation. This may be the result of inaccurate or incomplete genetic testing employed for selection of donor for transplantation. Based on MHC haplotype matching, MHC block matching has been developed for selection of potential unrelated donor. Block matching has been shown previously to improve outcome when added to the conventional method of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing for selection of donors. In this study, we have retrospectively analyzed 44 donor recipient pairs from the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry Repository with respect to matching of HLA-B and HLA-Cw by sequence-based typing and MICA and MICB by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer and MHC beta block matching and correlated these results with survival. Beta block matching was correlated with MIC matching (p < 0.005) and with HLA-B and HLA-Cw matching. Patients who were HLA-B and -Cw matched had significantly improved survival when they were additionally matched for MHC beta block (p(c) = 0.04) or MIC (p(c) = 0.05).
16866882 | The association between non-melanoma skin cancer and a young dimorphic Alu element within the major histocompatibility complex class I genomic region. A non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) susceptibility locus within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I region was previously identified telomeric of the HLA-C gene using high-density microsatellite markers. Here, we have extended the previous microsatellite study by using the same DNA samples obtained from 154 NMSC patients and 213 normal controls from the town of Busselton in Western Australia and examined the relationship between five polymorphic Alu insertions (POALINs) within the MHC class I region and their association with NMSC. The genotype distribution of the AluyTF insertion that is located within the NMSC susceptibility region telomeric of the HLA-C gene was significantly increased according to the Fisher's exact test in the NMSC patients, and it was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. There was no difference between the cancer patients and controls for the genotypes of the AluyMICB locus within intron 1 of the MICB gene and the other three POALINs (AluyHJ, AluyHG and AluyHF) that are located within the genomic region of the HLA-A, -G and -F gene cluster. The test for significant linkage disequilibrium for 10 pairs of POALIN loci and estimations of two locus POALIN haplotype frequencies also revealed AluyTF differences between the cases and controls. In conclusion, the MHC class I POALIN, AluyTF, that is located within the NMSC susceptibility locus and near the HLA-C gene was strongly associated with NMSC. This finding, using five different polymorphic Alu insertion markers, supports the previous microsatellite association study that one or more genes located in close proximity to the AluyTF insertion has a potential role in NMSC.
17580096 | African swine fever virus p37 structural protein is localized in nuclear foci containing the viral DNA at early post-infection times. The replication of African swine fever virus DNA is initiated inside the nucleus of host cells, being followed by a longer cytoplasmic replication stage. In face of previous results demonstrating the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling activity of ASFV p37 structural protein when considered isolated from the virus infection, we performed a systematic analysis of the subcellular localization of p37 protein in ASFV-infected cells, aiming at identifying the role of the nuclear transport mediated by this protein in the viral replication cycle. We report that the p37 protein of the incoming virions is localized throughout the cell at early times post-infection, concentrated in distinct nuclear regions, while at later times the newly synthesized protein is detected exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Experiments using leptomycin B and siRNAs targeting the CRM1 receptor demonstrate that the subcellular localization of p37 protein is not affected by inhibition of the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. Finally, results from in situ hybridization experiments show a co-localization of the ASFV DNA and p37 protein in specific nuclear regions at early times post-infection, and in viral factories at later times. Overall, these results support the involvement of p37 protein in the nuclear transport of the viral DNA during ASFV replication cycle.
17594804 | [Establishing a L02 cell model with whole HBV gene transfection and analyzing its expressions of HLA-A, B, C and MICA/B]. OBJECTIVE: To establish a cell model with HBV secretion by plasmid transfection with whole HBV genes into hepatic L02 cells, and to analyze the effect of HBV on the expression of HLA-A, B, C and MICA/B in L02 cells. METHODS: The mock control plasmid was built by digesting pEcob6 plasmid with EcoR I at the HBV DNA site and ligating the fragment without HBV DNA. The L02 cells were transfected with pEcob6 or mock plasmid and pcDNA3 1-neo by liposome. The expressions of HBsAg, HBcAg/HBeAg and HBV DNA were detected by immunofluorescence assay, Abbott enzymoimmunoassay, or FQ-PCR. The expressions of HLA-A, B, C and MICA/B were determined by FACS and the differences in the two molecules were analyzed. RESULTS: After the transfected cells were selected by G418, the HBsAg and HBeAg in the supernatant of L02-HBV cells were 24.78(S/N) and 4.117(S/N). The quantity of HBV DNA was 9.67 x 10(4) copies/ml, but in L02-mock and in L02 cells they were all negative. Under a confocal microscope HBsAg was brightly shown in the cytoplasm while HBcAg showed dimly in the cytoplasm or in the nuclei. By using FACS, the L02 and L02-mock cells showed some low expressions of HLA-A, B, C and a little expression of MICA/B, while the expression of the two molecules was higher in L02-HBV and the differences were significant (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A cell model with the expression of HBV antigens and the secretion of HBV DNA was established by pEcob6 transfection into L02 cells, the transcription or replication of HBV gene might induce stronger expressions of HLA-A, B, C and MICA/B on hepatic cells. They might be related to the immune injuries of hepatic cells.
17921352 | Trypanosoma brucei RNA binding proteins p34 and p37 mediate NOPP44/46 cellular localization via the exportin 1 nuclear export pathway. We have previously identified and characterized two novel nuclear RNA binding proteins, p34 and p37, which have been shown to interact with a family of nucleolar phosphoproteins, NOPP44/46, in Trypanosoma brucei. These proteins are nearly identical, the major difference being an 18-amino-acid insert in the N terminus of p37. In order to characterize the interaction between p34 and p37 and NOPP44/46, we have utilized an RNA interference (RNAi) cell line that specifically targets p34 and p37. Within these RNAi cells, we detected a disruption of a higher-molecular-weight complex containing NOPP44/46, as well as a dramatic increase in nuclear NOPP44/46 protein levels. We demonstrated that no change occurred in NOPP44/46 mRNA steady-state levels or stability, nor was there a change in cellular protein levels. These results led us to investigate whether p34 and p37 regulate NOPP44/46 cellular localization. Examination of the p34 and p37 amino acid sequences revealed a leucine-rich nuclear export signal, which interacts with the nuclear export factor exportin 1. Immune capture experiments demonstrated that p34, p37, and NOPP44/46 associate with exportin 1. When these experiments were performed with p34/p37 RNAi cells, NOPP44/46 no longer associated with exportin 1. Sequential immune capture experiments demonstrated that p34, p37, NOPP44/46, and exportin 1 exist in a common complex. Inhibiting exportin 1-mediated nuclear export led to an increase in nuclear NOPP44/46 proteins, indicating that they are exported from the nucleus via this pathway. Together, our results demonstrate that p34 and p37 regulate NOPP44/46 cellular localization by facilitating their association with exportin 1.
18723605 | Assembly of the Trypanosoma brucei 60S ribosomal subunit nuclear export complex requires trypanosome-specific proteins P34 and P37. We previously identified two Trypanosoma brucei RNA binding proteins, P34 and P37, and determined that they are essential for proper ribosomal assembly in this organism. Loss of these proteins via RNA interference is lethal and causes a decrease in both 5S rRNA levels and formation of 80S ribosomes, concomitant with a decrease in total cellular protein synthesis. These data suggest that these proteins are involved at some point in the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. In the current study, we have performed subcellular fractionation in conjunction with immune capture experiments specific for 60S ribosomal proteins and accessory factors in order to determine when and where P34 and P37 are involved in the ribosomal biogenesis pathway. These studies demonstrate that P34 and P37 associate with the 60S ribosomal subunit at the stage of the nucleolar 90S particle and remain associated subsequent to nuclear export. In addition, P34 and P37 associate with conserved 60S ribosomal subunit nuclear export factors exportin 1 and Nmd3, suggesting that they are components of the 60S ribosomal subunit nuclear export complex in T. brucei. Most significantly, the pre-60S complex does not associate with exportin 1 or Nmd3 in the absence of P34 and P37. These results demonstrate that, although T. brucei 60S ribosomal subunits utilize a nuclear export complex similar to that described for other organisms, trypanosome-specific factors are essential to the process.
19100459 | Stromal-derived factor-1 up-regulated the expression of MIC on mouse keratinocyte stem cells. Although previous studies have demonstrated that stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) played a key role in chronic graft dysfunction (CGD), the precise mechanisms underlying this process are not clear. In this study, SDF-1 was injected into keratinocyte stem cells (KSCs) which were isolated and purified from neonatal C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity of KSCs was measured and expressions of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related antigens A and B (MICA, MICB) detected by immunofluorescence. Cultured KSCs were negative for IA/IE MHC class II molecules by immunofluorescence, indicating the absence of any contamination with Langerhans cells and certifying the purity of KSCs. Over a 7-day culture period, SDF-1 up-regulated AC activity to 2.783 +/- 0.799, which was higher than that of the control group (1.290 +/- 0.476; P < .01). Immunostaining showed that KSCs expressed increased amounts of MICA protein (0.790 +/- 0.134 versus 0.200 +/- 0.022; P < .01) and MICB protein (0.610 +/- 0.832 versus 0.230 +/- 0.016; P < .01). Mixed lymphocyte reaction assays showed that KSCs cultured with SDF-1 injection for 7 days stimulated allogeneic T-cell proliferation. The data indicated that SDF-1 may accelerate the ultimate rejection of allogeneic keratinocytes by enhancing MIC through the AC signal pathway.
19115949 | Genomewide association study of an AIDS-nonprogression cohort emphasizes the role played by HLA genes (ANRS Genomewide Association Study 02). To elucidate the genetic factors predisposing to AIDS progression, we analyzed a unique cohort of 275 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-seropositive nonprogressor patients in relation to a control group of 1352 seronegative individuals in a genomewide association study (GWAS). The strongest association was obtained for HCP5 rs2395029 (P=6.79x10(-10); odds ratio, 3.47) and was possibly linked to an effect of sex. Interestingly, this single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was in high linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B, MICB, TNF, and several other HLA locus SNPs and haplotypes. A meta-analysis of our genomic data combined with data from the previously conducted Euro-CHAVI (Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology) GWAS confirmed the HCP5 signal (P=3.02x10(-19)) and identified several new associations, all of them involving HLA genes: MICB, TNF, RDBP, BAT1-5, PSORS1C1, and HLA-C. Finally, stratification by HCP5 rs2395029 genotypes emphasized an independent role for ZNRD1, also in the HLA locus, and this finding was confirmed by experimental data. The present study, the first GWAS of HIV-1 nonprogressors, underscores the potential for some HLA genes to control disease progression soon after infection.
19234348 | Evidence for natural killer cell-mediated protection from metastasis formation in uveal melanoma patients. PURPOSE: In uveal melanoma, low human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I expression on primary tumors is associated with a decreased risk of metastasis. Consequently, it has been suggested that natural killer (NK) cells, which detect decreased expression of HLA class I, are involved in the immune control of metastases. In this study, three novel lines of evidence were identified that support a role for NK cells. METHODS: Uveal melanoma cell lines were used to determine the expression of NK cell receptor ligands (MICA, MICB, ULBP1-3, CD112, CD155, and HLA class I) and to examine sensitivity to lysis by human NK cell lines. Because interactions between polymorphic killer immunoglobulin receptors (KIRs) and HLA regulate NK cell function, KIR and HLA genotyping was performed on 154 patients with uveal melanoma and 222 healthy control subjects. RESULTS: First, all 11 uveal melanoma cell lines tested expressed ligands for activating as well as inhibitory NK cell receptors. Second, such cell lines were lysed efficiently by human NK cells in vitro. Finally, the HLA-C genotype was related to the risk of metastasis-related death in patients with uveal melanoma: The patients carrying HLA-C alleles encoding ligands for KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2/3 (HLA-C group 1/group 2 heterozygous patients), both inhibitory NK receptors, had a longer metastasis-free survival than did those carrying HLA-C ligands for either KIR2DL1 (HLA-C group 2 homozygotes) or KIR2DL2/3 (HLA-C group 1 homozygotes). CONCLUSIONS: Together, the data support a role for NK cells in the prevention of uveal melanoma metastases.
20371213 | The impact of immunogenetics and clinical factors on the outcome of unrelated cord blood transplantation: the Milano Cord Blood Bank data. In this article we examined the role of HLA incompatibility, of KIR C1 and C2 ligands and of other clinical factors on 99 cord blood transplants performed using single units from Milano Cord Blood Bank (MICB). We analyzed the occurrence of rejection, overall patient survival (OS) and occurrence of acute GvHD >or= 2 grade (severe aGvHD). No correlation was found between the end points and the number of HLA-A,-B, -DRB1 and -DQB1 mismatches. Only HLA-C disparities are associated with the occurrence of rejection (P=0.03). Our results showed that the presence of the C1 ligand in the donor decreased the occurrence of aGvHD (grade >or= 2) in the recipient while recipients of donors expressing the C2 KIR ligand experienced more frequently aGvHD (P=0.03). The HLA-C1 ligand, therefore, proved to have a protective effect towards severe aGvHD. The probability of rejection increased in KIR epitope-mismatched recipient/donor pairs (P=0.01). Finally the stage of disease at transplantation and cell dose were important for patient survival (P=0.003, P=0.048 respectively).
20492592 | The association and differentiation of MHC class I polymorphic Alu insertions and HLA-B/Cw alleles in seven Chinese populations. We investigated polymorphic Alu insertion (POALIN) frequencies at five loci in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genomic region to determine their allele and haplotype frequencies and associations with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B and -Cw genes in seven different Chinese ethnic populations, the Han, Bulang, Wa, Dai, Maonan, Hani and Jinuo. The POALINs varied in frequency between 0% and 42.3% with significant differences between populations at all of the loci. Each POALIN was in significant linkage disequilibrium with a variety of HLA-B or -Cw four-digit alleles. The percentage association between Alu insertions and the HLA-B or -Cw alleles was calculated in pairwise analyses of haplotypes to show possible crossing over events between loci. The POALIN insertions also helped to further stratify the HLA-B:-Cw haplotypes into different POALIN:HLA-B:HLA-Cw haplotype frequencies. Of the two-locus, five-locus and seven-locus haplotype analyses, the seven-locus haplotypes showed the largest number of differences between the populations. The most common multilocus haplotype in Han was MICB*1:B*4601:Cw*0102:TF*1:HJ*1:HG*2:HF*1 (15.6%) associated with the AluHG insertion, whereas the second most common multilocus haplotype in Han was MICB*1:B*1502:Cw*0801:TF*1:HJ*2:HG*1:HF*1 (11.8%) associated with the AluHJ insertion. This comparative study of multilocus POALINs in the HLA class I region of seven Chinese ethnic populations shows that POALINs alone or together with the HLA class I alleles are informative genetic markers for the identification of HLA class I allele and haplotype lineages and variations such as crossing over events within the same and/or different populations.
21664939 | Characterization of the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene B (MICB) polymorphism in a northern Chinese Han population: the identification of a new MICB allele, MICB*023. Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene B (MICB) has only been characterized for allelic variation in very few human populations. The MICB polymorphism remains largely unknown in Chinese populations. In this study, 104 healthy unrelated Han subjects recruited from central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, northern China, were investigated by sequence-based typing for MICB allelic variation, the association of MICB alleles with AluyMICB insertion/deletion dimorphism located in MICB intron 1, linkage disequilibrium of MICB with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B and MICA, and HLA-A-C-B-MICA-MICB haplotypic diversity. Ten kinds of MICB alleles were observed, among which MICB*005:02/010, MICB*002:01, and MICB*004:01 were the most frequent alleles with frequencies of 51.44, 16.35, and 11.54%, respectively. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed for 9 of the 21 HLA-B-MICB haplotypes and 6 of the 17 MICA-MICB haplotypes with a frequency >1.5%. In particular, HLA-B*13:01 and HLA-B*13:02, both of which were frequently represented in this population, exhibited a distinct LD pattern with the MICB allele. A new MICB allele, MICB*023, was identified, which differed from MICB*005:02/010 by a single mutation of G to A at position 86 in exon 2, resulting in an amino acid change from arginine to histidine at codon 6. HLA-A*30-C*06-B*13:02-MICA*008:01-MICB*005:02/010 was the most common haplotype, with a frequency of 8.64% in this population. HLA-A*02-C*08-B*48-MICA*Del-MICB*009N demonstrated a frequency of 2.4% in this population. Our results provide for the first time data regarding the MICB genetic polymorphism in northern Chinese Han populations and will form the basis for future studies of the potential role of MICB in allogeneic organ transplantation and disease association in related ethnic groups.
22286212 | Genome-wide association study of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and Epstein-Barr virus status-defined subgroups. BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that risk factors for classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) differ by tumor Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status. This potential etiological heterogeneity is not recognized in current disease classification. METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide association study of 1200 cHL patients and 6417 control subjects, with validation in an independent replication series, to identify common genetic variants associated with total cHL and subtypes defined by tumor EBV status. Multiple logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) assuming a log-additive genetic model for the variants. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Two novel loci associated with total cHL irrespective of EBV status were identified in the major histocompatibility complex region; one resides adjacent to MICB (rs2248462: OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.69, P = 1.3 x 10(-13)) and the other at HLA-DRA (rs2395185: OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.50 to 0.62, P = 8.3 x 10(-25)) with both results confirmed in an independent replication series. Consistent with previous reports, associations were found between EBV-positive cHL and genetic variants within the class I region (rs2734986, HLA-A: OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 2.00 to 3.00, P = 1.2 x 10(-15); rs6904029, HCG9: OR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.59, P = 5.5 x 10(-10)) and between EBV-negative cHL and rs6903608 within the class II region (rs6903608, HLA-DRA: OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.84 to 2.35, P = 6.1 x 10(-31)). The association between rs6903608 and EBV-negative cHL was confined to the nodular sclerosis histological subtype. Evidence for an association between EBV-negative cHL and rs20541 (5q31, IL13: OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.32 to 1.76, P = 5.4 x 10(-9)), a variant previously linked to psoriasis and asthma, was observed; however, the evidence for replication was less clear. Notably, one additional psoriasis-associated variant, rs27524 (5q15, ERAP1), showed evidence of an association with cHL in the genome-wide association study (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.33, P = 1.5 x 10(-4)) and replication series (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Overall, these results provide strong evidence that EBV status is an etiologically important classification of cHL and also suggest that some components of the pathological process are common to both EBV-positive and EBV-negative patients.
22448298 | Protective human leucocyte antigen haplotype, HLA-DRB1*01-B*14, against chronic Chagas disease in Bolivia. BACKGROUND: Chagas disease, caused by the flagellate parasite Trypanosoma cruzi affects 8-10 million people in Latin America. The mechanisms that underlie the development of complications of chronic Chagas disease, characterized primarily by pathology of the heart and digestive system, are not currently understood. To identify possible host genetic factors that may influence the clinical course of Chagas disease, Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) regional gene polymorphism was analyzed in patients presenting with differing clinical symptoms. METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and twenty nine chronic Chagas disease patients in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, were examined by serological tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), and Barium enema colon X-ray. 31.4% of the examinees showed ECG alterations, 15.7% megacolon and 58.1% showed neither of them. A further 62 seropositive megacolon patients who had undergone colonectomy due to acute abdomen were recruited. We analyzed their HLA genetic polymorphisms (HLA-A, HLA-B, MICA, MICB, DRB1 and TNF-alpha promoter region) mainly through Sequence based and LABType SSO typing test using LUMINEX Technology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The frequencies of HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-B*14:02 were significantly lower in patients suffering from megacolon as well as in those with ECG alteration and/or megacolon compared with a group of patients with indeterminate symptoms. The DRB1*0102, B*1402 and MICA*011 alleles were in strong Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), and the HLA-DRB1*01-B*14-MICA*011 haplotype was associated with resistance against chronic Chagas disease. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of HLA haplotype association with resistance to chronic Chagas disease.
22609444 | MICB polymorphism in a southern Chinese Han population: the identification of two new MICB alleles, MICB*005:06 and MICB*026. In this study, we investigated the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene B (MICB) allelic variation by sequence-based typing (SBT) in 201 healthy, unrelated Han subjects from Hunan province, southern China. Eleven MICB alleles were observed, among which MICB(*)005:02 predominated with a frequency of 64.93%. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed for 5 HLA-B-MICB and 6 MICA-MICB haplotypes. Compared with a northern Chinese Han population, several MICB-containing haplotypes appeared to be highly specific to this southern Chinese Han population. Two new MICB alleles, MICB(*)005:06 and MICB(*)026, were identified. Aligned with MICB(*)005:02, MICB(*)005:06 has a synonymous T replacement at nucleotide 762 in exon 4; MICB(*)026 has probably arisen from MICB(*)004:01 through a single nucleotide substitution from G to A at position 826 in exon 4, leading to an amino acid change from glutamic acid to lysine at codon 253. HLA-A(*)02-C(*)01-B(*)46-MICA(*)010-MICB(*)005:02-DRB1(*)09 was the most prevalent six-locus haplotype with a frequency of 8.49%. HLA-A(*)30-C(*)06-B(*)13:02-MICA(*)008:01-MICB(*)005:02-DRB1(*)07 appeared to be a conserved extended haplotype. Our results provide new information about MICB genetic polymorphism in Chinese Han populations, and will inform future studies of the potential role of MICB in allogeneic organ transplantation and disease susceptibility in related ethnic groups.
23084292 | Unraveling multiple MHC gene associations with systemic lupus erythematosus: model choice indicates a role for HLA alleles and non-HLA genes in Europeans. We have performed a meta-analysis of the major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) region in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to determine the association with both SNPs and classical human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) alleles. More specifically, we combined results from six studies and well-known out-of-study control data sets, providing us with 3,701 independent SLE cases and 12,110 independent controls of European ancestry. This study used genotypes for 7,199 SNPs within the MHC region and for classical HLA alleles (typed and imputed). Our results from conditional analysis and model choice with the use of the Bayesian information criterion show that the best model for SLE association includes both classical loci (HLA-DRB1(*)03:01, HLA-DRB1(*)08:01, and HLA-DQA1(*)01:02) and two SNPs, rs8192591 (in class III and upstream of NOTCH4) and rs2246618 (MICB in class I). Our approach was to perform a stepwise search from multiple baseline models deduced from a priori evidence on HLA-DRB1 lupus-associated alleles, a stepwise regression on SNPs alone, and a stepwise regression on HLA alleles. With this approach, we were able to identify a model that was an overwhelmingly better fit to the data than one identified by simple stepwise regression either on SNPs alone (Bayes factor [BF] > 50) or on classical HLA alleles alone (BF > 1,000).
23549730 | Distribution of MICB diversity in the Zhejiang Han population: PCR sequence-based typing for exons 2-6 and identification of five novel MICB alleles. The polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene B (MICB) and variations in MICB alleles in a variety of populations have been characterized using several genotyping approaches. In the present study, a novel polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method was established for the genotyping of MICB exons 2-6, and the allelic frequency of MICB in the Zhejiang Han population was investigated. Among 400 unrelated healthy Han individuals from Zhejiang Province, China, a total of 20 MICB alleles were identified, of which MICB*005:02:01, MICB*002:01:01, and MICB*004:01:01 were the most predominant alleles, with frequencies of 0.57375, 0.1225, and 0.08375, respectively. Nine MICB alleles were detected on only one occasion, giving a frequency of 0.00125. Of the 118 distinct MICB ~ HLA-B haplotypes identified, 42 showed significant linkage disequilibrium (P < 0.05). Haplotypes MICB*005:02:01 ~ B*46:01, MICB*005:02:01 ~ B*40:01, and MICB*008 ~ B*58:01 were the most common haplotypes, with frequencies of 0.0978, 0.0761, and 0.0616, respectively. Five novel alleles, MICB*005:07, MICB*005:08, MICB*027, MICB*028, and MICB*029 were identified. Compared with the MICB*005:02:01 sequence, a G > A substitution was observed at nucleotide position 210 in MICB*005:07, and a 1,134 T > C substitution in MICB*005:08 and an 862 G > A substitution in MICB*027 were detected. In addition, it appears that MICB*028 probably arose from MICB*004:01:01 with an A to G substitution at position 1,147 in exon 6. MICB*029 had a G > T transversion at nucleotide position 730 in exon 4, compared with that of MICB*002:01:01. On the basis of the new PCR-SBT assay, these observed results demonstrated MICB allelic variations in the Zhejiang Han population.
24278027 | Fine-mapping the genetic association of the major histocompatibility complex in multiple sclerosis: HLA and non-HLA effects. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region is strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. HLA-DRB1*15:01 has the strongest effect, and several other alleles have been reported at different levels of validation. Using SNP data from genome-wide studies, we imputed and tested classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms in 8 classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes in 5,091 cases and 9,595 controls. We identified 11 statistically independent effects overall: 6 HLA-DRB1 and one DPB1 alleles in class II, one HLA-A and two B alleles in class I, and one signal in a region spanning from MICB to LST1. This genomic segment does not contain any HLA class I or II genes and provides robust evidence for the involvement of a non-HLA risk allele within the MHC. Interestingly, this region contains the TNF gene, the cognate ligand of the well-validated TNFRSF1A MS susceptibility gene. The classical HLA effects can be explained to some extent by polymorphic amino acid positions in the peptide-binding grooves. This study dissects the independent effects in the MHC, a critical region for MS susceptibility that harbors multiple risk alleles. 
24556715 | Soluble major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain B molecules are increased and correlate with clinical outcomes during rhinovirus infection in healthy subjects. BACKGROUND: Surface major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain (MIC) A and B molecules are increased by IL-15 and have a role in the activation of natural killer group 2 member D-positive natural killer and CD8 T cells. MICA and MICB also exist in soluble forms (sMICA and sMICB). Rhinoviruses (RVs) are the major cause of asthma exacerbations, and IL-15 levels are decreased in the airways of subjects with asthma. The role of MIC molecules in immune responses in the lung has not been studied. Here, we determine the relationship between MICA and MICB and RV infection in vitro in respiratory epithelial cells and in vivo in healthy subjects and subjects with asthma. METHODS: Surface MICA and MICB, as well as sMICA and sMICB, in respiratory epithelial cells were measured in vitro in response to RV infection and exposure to IL-15. Levels of sMICA and sMICB in serum, sputum, and BAL were measured and correlated with blood and bronchoalveolar immune cells in healthy subjects and subjects with asthma before and during RV infection. RESULTS: RV increased MICA and MICB in vitro in epithelial cells. Exogenous IL-15 upregulated sMICB levels in RV-infected epithelial cells. Levels of sMICB molecules in serum were increased in healthy subjects compared with subjects with stable asthma. Following RV infection, airway levels of sMIC are upregulated, and there are positive correlations between sputum MICB levels and the percentage of bronchoalveolar natural killer cells in healthy subjects but not subjects with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: RV infection induces MIC molecules in respiratory epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Induction of MICB molecules is impaired in subjects with asthma, suggesting these molecules may have a role in the antiviral immune response to RV infections.
25061499 | Biological significance and therapeutic implication of resveratrol-inhibited Wnt, Notch and STAT3 signaling in cervical cancer cells. Cervical cancers/CCs are one of the commonest malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Resveratrol inhibits CC cell growth but its molecular target(s) remains unclear. Since the signaling pathways mediated by STAT3, Notch1 and Wnt2 play beneficial roles in CC formation and progression, the effects of resveratrol on them in cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) and squamous cell carcinoma (SiHa) cells were analyzed. The biological significances of the above signaling for HeLa and SiHa cells were evaluated by treating the cells with STAT3, Wnt or Notch selective inhibitors. The frequencies of STAT3, Notch and Wnt activations in 68 cases of CC specimens and 38 non-cancerous cervical epithelia were examined by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining. The results revealed that HeLa and SiHa cells treated by 100muM resveratrol showed extensive apoptosis, accompanied with suppression of STAT3, Notch and Wnt activations. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were found in HeLa and SiHa populations treated by AG490, a STAT3/JAK3 inhibitor but not the ones treated by Notch inhibitor L-685,458 or by Wnt inhibitor XAV-939. Immunohistochemical staining performed on the tissue microarrays showed that the frequencies of Notch1, Notch2, Hes1, Wnt2, Wnt5a and p-STAT3 detection as well as beta-catenin nuclear translocation in CC samples were significantly higher than that of noncancerous group (p<0.01), while the expression rate of PIAS3 was remarkably low in cancer samples (p<0.01). Our results thus demonstrate that STAT3, Wnt and Notch signaling are frequently co-activated in human CC cells and specimens and resveratrol can concurrently inhibit those signaling activations and meanwhile lead cervical squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma cells to growth arrest and apoptosis. STAT3 signaling is more critical for CC cells and is the major target of resveratrol because selective inhibition of STAT3 rather than Wnt or Notch activation commits SiHa and HeLa cells to apoptosis. 
25484218 | Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic study of human Hikeshi, a new nuclear transport receptor for Hsp70. Hikeshi is a new nuclear transport receptor that plays an important role in the nuclear import of Hsp70 heat-shock proteins under thermal stress. Wild-type human Hikeshi and its Phe97Ala mutant were overproduced and purified using an Escherichia coli expression system. The purified proteins were crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion technique. Wild-type crystals grew in space group C2221, with unit-cell parameters a = 61.1, b = 137.8, c = 97.9 A, alpha = 90.0, beta = 90.0, gamma = 90.0 . Phe97Ala mutant crystals were obtained in space group P32, with unit-cell parameters a = 85.7, b = 85.7, c = 69.1 A, alpha = 90.0, beta = 90.0, gamma = 120.0 . These crystals diffracted to 1.8 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. This study is the first to yield structural insight into this highly unusual fourth import receptor after importins, NTF2 and TAP.
25990310 | Identification of a novel MICB allele, MICB*030, by cloning and sequencing. A novel MICB allele, MICB*030, has been identified in a healthy Chinese individual of Mongol ethnicity residing in northern China by polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) and confirmed by cloning and sequencing. MICB*030 was linked to HLA-B*35. Aligned with MICB*005:02, MICB*030 has a nonsynonymous adenine substitution at nucleotide position 50 in exon 3, leading to amino acid change from serine to arginine at codon 102 of the mature MICB molecule. 
27028549 | MICA, MICB Polymorphisms and Linkage Disequilibrium with HLA-B in a Chinese Mongolian Population. In this study, polymorphisms of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related genes A and B (MICA and MICB) and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-B gene were investigated for 158 unrelated Chinese Mongolian subjects recruited from central Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, northern China, by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) and cloning. Collectively, 79 alleles, including 20 MICA, 12 MICB and 47 HLA-B alleles, were identified. MICA*008:01 (21.2%), MICB*005:02 (48.1%) and HLA-B*51:01 (7.91%) were the most common alleles. Significant global linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected between HLA-B and MICA, HLA-B and MICB, and MICA and MICB loci (all P < 0.000001). The most frequent haplotypes were HLA-B*51:01-MICA*009:01 (7.28%), HLA-B*58:01-MICB*008 (6.96%), MICA*010-MICB*005:02 (13.92%) and HLA-B*58:01-MICA*002:01-MICB*008 (6.96%). HLA-B-MICA haplotypes such as HLA-B*50:01-MICA*009:02 were associated with single MICB allele. Some HLA-B-MICA haplotypes were associated with multiple MICB alleles, including HLA-B*51:01-MICA*009:01. One novel MICB allele, MICB*031, was identified, which has possibly arisen from MICB*002:01 through single mutation event. We also confirmed the existence of a recently recognized MICA allele, MICA*073, whose ethnic origin has not been previously described. Genotype distributions at MICA, MICB and HLA-B were consistent with a neutrality model. Our results provide new insight into MIC genetic polymorphisms in Chinese ethnic groups. Findings shown here are important from an anthropologic perspective and will inform future studies of the potential role of MIC genes in allogeneic organ transplantation and HLA-linked disease association in populations of related ancestry. 
28379387 | A new MHC-linked susceptibility locus for primary Sjogren's syndrome: MICA. The association of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) with Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) alleles is quintessential of MHC-disease associations. Indeed, although disease associations with classical HLA class I and II alleles/haplotypes are amply documented, further dissection is often prevented by the strong linkage disequilibrium across the entire MHC complex. Here we study the association of pSS, not with HLA genes, but with the non-conventional MHC encoded class I gene, MICA (MHC class I chain-related gene A). MICA is selectively expressed within epithelia, and is the major ligand for the activatory receptor, NKG2D, both attributes relevant to pSS' etiology. MICA-pSS association was studied in two independent (French and UK) cohorts representing a total of 959 cases and 1,043 controls. MICA*008 allele was shown to be significantly associated with pSS (pcor=2.61 x 10-35). A multivariate logistic regression showed that this association was independent of all major known MHC-linked risk loci/alleles, as well as other relevant candidate loci that are in linkage disequilibrium with MICA*008 i.e. HLA-B*08:01, rs3131619 (T), MICB*008, TNF308A, HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB1*15:01 (P = 1.84 x 10-04). Furthermore, independently of the MICA*008 allele, higher levels of soluble MICA proteins were detected in sera of pSS patients compared to healthy controls. This study hence defines MICA as a new, MHC-linked, yet HLA-independent, pSS risk locus and opens a new front in our understanding of the still enigmatic pathophysiology of this disease. The fact that the soluble MICA protein is further amplified in MICA*008 carrying individuals, might also be relevant in other auto-immune diseases and cancer.
28560257 | Generating testable hypotheses for schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis by integrating epidemiological, genomic, and protein interaction data. Patients with schizophrenia and their relatives have reduced prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis. Schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis genome-wide association studies also indicate negative genetic correlations, suggesting that there may be shared pathogenesis at the DNA level or downstream. A portion of the inverse prevalence could be attributed to pleiotropy, i.e., variants of a single nucleotide polymorphism that could confer differential risk for these disorders. To study the basis for such an interrelationship, we initially compared lists of single nucleotide polymorphisms with significant genetic associations (p < 1e-8) for schizophrenia or rheumatoid arthritis, evaluating patterns of linkage disequilibrium and apparent pleiotropic risk profiles. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that conferred risk for both schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis were localized solely to the extended HLA region. Among single nucleotide polymorphisms that conferred differential risk for schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis, the majority were localized to HLA-B, TNXB, NOTCH4, HLA-C, HCP5, MICB, PSORS1C1, and C6orf10; published functional data indicate that HLA-B and HLA-C have the most plausible pathogenic roles in both disorders. Interactomes of these eight genes were constructed from protein-protein interaction information using publicly available databases and novel computational predictions. The genes harboring apparently pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms are closely connected to rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia associated genes through common interacting partners. A separate and independent analysis of the interactomes of rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia genes showed a significant overlap between the two interactomes and that they share several common pathways, motivating functional studies suggesting a relationship in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia/rheumatoid arthritis.
29781763 | New Insights into the Nucleolar Localization of a Plant RNA Virus-Encoded Protein That Acts in Both RNA Packaging and RNA Silencing Suppression: Involvement of Importins Alpha and Relevance for Viral Infection. Despite the fact that replication of plus-strand RNA viruses takes place in the cytoplasm of host cells, different proteins encoded by these infectious agents have been shown to localize in the nucleus, with high accumulation at the nucleolus. In most cases, the molecular determinants or biological significance of such subcellular localization remains elusive. Recently, we reported that protein p37 encoded by Pelargonium line pattern virus (family Tombusviridae) acts in both RNA packaging and RNA silencing suppression. Consistently with these functions, p37 was detected in the cytoplasm of plant cells, although it was also present in the nucleus and, particularly, in the nucleolus. Here, we searched for further insights into factors influencing p37 nucleolar localization and into its potential relevance for viral infection. Besides mapping the protein region containing the nucleolar localization signal, we have found that p37 interacts with distinct members of the importin alpha family-main cellular transporters for nucleo-cytoplasmic traffic of proteins-and that these interactions are crucial for nucleolar targeting of p37. Impairment of p37 nucleolar localization through downregulation of importin alpha expression resulted in a reduction of viral accumulation, suggesting that sorting of the protein to the major subnuclear compartment is advantageous for the infection process.
30498034 | Genetic determinants and an epistasis of LILRA3 and HLA-B*52 in Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a systemic vasculitis with severe complications that affects the aorta and its large branches. HLA-B*52 is an established susceptibility locus to TAK. To date, there are still only a limited number of reports concerning non-HLA susceptibility loci to TAK. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a follow-up study in a total of 633 TAK cases and 5,928 controls. A total of 510,879 SNPs were genotyped, and 5,875,450 SNPs were imputed together with HLA-B*52. Functional annotation of significant loci, enhancer enrichment, and pathway analyses were conducted. We identified four unreported significant loci, namely rs2322599, rs103294, rs17133698, and rs1713450, in PTK2B, LILRA3/LILRB2, DUSP22, and KLHL33, respectively. Two additional significant loci unreported in non-European GWAS were identified, namely HSPA6/FCGR3A and chr21q.22. We found that a single variant associated with the expression of MICB, a ligand for natural killer (NK) cell receptor, could explain the entire association with the HLA-B region. Rs2322599 is strongly associated with the expression of PTK2B Rs103294 risk allele in LILRA3/LILRB2 is known to be a tagging SNP for the deletion of LILRA3, a soluble receptor of HLA class I molecules. We found a significant epistasis effect between HLA-B*52 and rs103294 (P = 1.2 x 10-3). Enhancer enrichment analysis and pathway analysis suggested the involvement of NK cells (P = 8.8 x 10-5, enhancer enrichment). In conclusion, four unreported TAK susceptibility loci and an epistasis effect between LILRA3 and HLA-B*52 were identified. HLA and non-HLA regions suggested a critical role for NK cells in TAK.
30561160 | Characterization of a novel MICB variant in an individual from the Chinese Uyghur population, MICB*005:09, by cloning and sequencing. A new allelic variant in MICB*005 lineage, MICB*005:09, has been identified in a male Uyghur individual recruited from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China by PCR-sequence-based typing (Sanger sequencing) and confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Aligned with MICB*005:03, this new allelic variant shows a synonymous T substitution at nucleotide position 8 in exon 2, corresponding to codon 3 (CAC CAT) of the mature MICB mRNA transcript.
31137555 | Long Noncoding RNA HCP5, a Hybrid HLA Class I Endogenous Retroviral Gene: Structure, Expression, and Disease Associations. The HCP5 RNA gene (NCBI ID: 10866) is located centromeric of the HLA-B gene and between the MICA and MICB genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I region. It is a human species-specific gene that codes for a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), composed mostly of an ancient ancestral endogenous antisense 3' long terminal repeat (LTR, and part of the internal pol antisense sequence of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) type 16 linked to a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I promoter and leader sequence at the 5'-end. Since its discovery in 1993, many disease association and gene expression studies have shown that HCP5 is a regulatory lncRNA involved in adaptive and innate immune responses and associated with the promotion of some autoimmune diseases and cancers. The gene sequence acts as a genomic anchor point for binding transcription factors, enhancers, and chromatin remodeling enzymes in the regulation of transcription and chromatin folding. The HCP5 antisense retroviral transcript also interacts with regulatory microRNA and immune and cellular checkpoints in cancers suggesting its potential as a drug target for novel antitumor therapeutics.
31504236 | Handedness, language areas and neuropsychiatric diseases: insights from brain imaging and genetics. Ninety per cent of the human population has been right-handed since the Paleolithic, yet the brain signature and genetic basis of handedness remain poorly characterized. Here, we correlated brain imaging phenotypes from ~9000 UK Biobank participants with handedness, and with loci found significantly associated with handedness after we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in ~400 000 of these participants. Our imaging-handedness analysis revealed an increase in functional connectivity between left and right language networks in left-handers. GWAS of handedness uncovered four significant loci (rs199512, rs45608532, rs13017199, and rs3094128), three of which are in-or expression quantitative trait loci of-genes encoding proteins involved in brain development and patterning. These included microtubule-related MAP2 and MAPT, as well as WNT3 and MICB, all implicated in the pathogenesis of diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. In particular, with rs199512, we identified a common genetic influence on handedness, psychiatric phenotypes, Parkinson's disease, and the integrity of white matter tracts connecting the same language-related regions identified in the handedness-imaging analysis. This study has identified in the general population genome-wide significant loci for human handedness in, and expression quantitative trait loci of, genes associated with brain development, microtubules and patterning. We suggest that these genetic variants contribute to neurodevelopmental lateralization of brain organization, which in turn influences both the handedness phenotype and the predisposition to develop certain neurological and psychiatric diseases.
33297781 | HLA-Cw6 and other HLA-C alleles, as well as MICB-DT, DDX58, and TYK2 genetic variants associate with optimal response to anti-IL-17A treatment in patients with psoriasis. Objective: Our pharmacogenomic study evaluated the influence of the presence/absence of genetic variants of psoriasis-risk loci on the clinical response to secukinumab. Differences in the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pattern characterizing HLA-Cw6+ or HLA-Cw6- patient subpopulations, showing high or low responses to secukinumab, were also analyzed. Methods: 417 SNPs were analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing technology, in a cohort of 62 psoriatic patients and undergone secukinumab treatment. Univariate regression analysis was employed to examine the association between SNP and clinical response to secukinumab. Multivariate analysis was also performed to assess multivariate differences in SNP pattern of HLA-Cw6+ or HLA-Cw6- patients showing high or low responses to secukinumab. Results: Eight SNPs in HLA-C and upstream region (rs13207315, rs6900444, rs12189871, rs12191877, rs4406273, and rs10484554), including HLA-Cw6 classical allele (rs1131118), and three in MICB-DT (rs9267325), DDX58 (rs34085293) and TYK2 (rs2304255) genes, associating with excellent response to secukinumab were identified. Importantly, rs34085293 or rs2304255 SNP status defined a subgroup of super-responder patients. We also found that HLA-Cw6+ and HLA-Cw6- patients carried out specific patterns of SNPs associating with different responses to secukinumab. Conclusion: Assessment of HLA-Cw6, together with other allelic variants of genes, could be helpful to define patients which better benefit from anti-IL-17 therapy. Abbreviations: PASI: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; SNP: Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Rs: Reference SNP; PASI75: 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PASI90: 90% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PASI100: 100% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; NGS: Next-Generation Sequencing; OR: Odds Ratio; CAP: Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates; BMI: Body Mass Index; LD: Linkage Disequilibrium.
33552945 | Identification of Immune-Related lncRNA Signature to Predict Prognosis and Immunotherapeutic Efficiency in Bladder Cancer. PURPOSE: Identify immune-related lncRNA (IRL) signature related to the prognosis and immunotherapeutic efficiency for bladder cancer (BLCA) patients. METHODS: A total of 397 samples, which contained RNA-seq and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, were used for the following study. Then the Lasso penalized Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to construct prognostic signature. According to the optimal cut-off value determined by time-dependent ROC curve, low and high-risk groups were set up. One immunotherapy microarray dataset as validation set was used to verify the ability of predicting immunotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, more evaluation between two risk groups related clinical factors were conducted. Finally, external validation of IRL-signature was conducted in Zhengzhou cohort. RESULT: Four IRLs (HCP5, IPO5P1, LINC00942, and LINC01356) with significant prognostic value (P<0.05) were distinguished. This signature can accurately predict the overall survival of BLCA patients and was verified in the immunotherapy validation set. IRL-signatures can be used as independent prognostic risk factor in various clinical subgroups. According to the results of GSVA and MCP algorithm, we found that IRL-signature risk score is strikingly negative correlated with tumor microenvironment (TME) CD8+T cells and Cytotoxic lymphocytes infiltration, indicating that the better prognosis and immunotherapy might be caused partly by these. Then, the results from the TIDE analysis revealed that IRL could efficiently predict the response of immunotherapy in BLCA. External validation had similar results with TCGA-BLCA cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The novel IRL-signature has a significant prognostic value for BLCA patients might facilitate predicting the efficacy of immunotherapy.
34650978 | Increased Nuclear Transporter Importin 7 Contributes to the Tumor Growth and Correlates With CD8 T Cell Infiltration in Cervical Cancer. Background: Importin 7 (IPO7), a karyopherin-beta protein, is involved in various tumorigenesis and progression abilities by mediating the nuclear import of oncoproteins. However, the exact biological functions of IPO7 remain to be further elucidated. Materials and Methods: TCGA and GEO datasets were used to identify dysregulated expression of IPO7 in various cancers. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses were used to identify the oncogenic functions of IPO7 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, LC-MS/MS and parallel reaction monitoring analysis were used to comparatively profiled IPO7-related proteomics and potential molecular machinery. Results: Our works demonstrated that the expression of IPO7 was upregulated and was correlated with a poor prognosis in cervical cancer. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that knockdown of IPO7 inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and C-4 I cells. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that IPO7-related cargo proteins mainly were enriched in gene transcription regulation. Then independent PRM analysis for the first time demonstrated that 32 novel IPO7 cargo proteins, such as GTF2I, RORC1, PSPC1, and RBM25. Moreover, IPO7 contributed to activating the PI3K/AKT-mTOR pathway by mediating the nuclear import of GTF2I in cervical cancer cells. Intriguingly, we found that the IPO7 expression was negatively correlated with CD8 T cell infiltration via regulating the expression of CD276 in cervical cancer. Conclusion: This study enhances our understanding of IPO7 nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation and might reveal novel potential therapeutic targets. The results of a negative correlation between the IPO7 and CD8 T cell infiltration indicate that the IPO7 might play an important impact on the immune microenvironment of cervical cancer.
35792283 | Polymorphisms in immune-mediator genes and the risk of dengue virus infection: Lights from a systematic revaluation by Bayesian approaches. Dengue fever is a clinical manifestation of dengue virus (DENV) infection well defined by the intense host immune response with the development of high fever, anorexia, headache and muscle pain. Several immune mediators are involved in the pathophysiology of DENV infection, in which polymorphisms in immune molecule genes contribute with the susceptibility and severity of the infection. Several meta-analyses are available with significant findings in the association between genetic variants in immune-mediator genes and dengue, though the results may be false positive. Hence, to solve this issue, we have performed a systematic revaluation with Bayesian approaches to verify the false positive rate in these results. A systematic search was performed for meta-analytic studies on the aforementioned issue. The calculations of false positive report probability (FPRP) and the Bayesian false-discovery probability (BFDP) at the prior probability of 10-3 and 10-6 have been performed. To verify the methodological quality of the studies included, the evaluation by the Venice criteria was applied. In addition, gene-gene and protein-protein networks were designed. As results, seven meta-analyses on genetic variants in several immune-inflammatory mediator genes and DENV infection comprise the results. Only the polymorphisms in the TNF, MICB, PLCE1, VDR, CD32 and HLA-A genes were considered as noteworthy. There was a heterogeneity profile for the results on Venice criteria indicating variability in the methodological quality. The gene-gene and protein-protein networks showed these immune mediators as relevant players in the disease. We suggest these polymorphisms as potential biomarkers for the pathogenesis and immune response against DENV.
37307368 | Germline variants of the genes involved in NF-kB activation are associated with the risk of COPD and lung cancer development. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC) are closely related diseases associated with smoking history and dysregulated immune response. However, not all smokers develop the disease, indicating that genetic susceptibility could be important. Therefore, the aim of this study was to search for the potential overlapping genetic biomarkers, with a focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the regulatory regions of immune-related genes. Additionally, the aim was to see if an identified SNP has potentially an effect on proinflamma-tory cytokine concentration in the serum of COPD patients. We extracted summary data of variants in 1511 immune-related genes from COPD and LC genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the UK Biobank. The LC data had 203 cases, patients diagnosed with LC, and 360 938 controls, while COPD data had 1 897 cases and 359 297 controls. Assuming 1 association/gene, SNPs with a p-value < 3.3 x 10-5 were considered statistically significantly associated with the disease. We identified seven SNPs located in different genes (BAG6, BTNL2, TNF, HCP5, MICB, NCR3, ABCF1, TCF7L1) to be associated with the COPD risk and two with the LC risk (HLA-C, HLA-B), with statistical significance. We also identified two SNPs located in the IL2RA gene associated with LC (rs2386841; p = 1.86 x 10-4) and COPD (rs11256442; p = 9.79 x 10-3) but with lower significance. Functional studies conducted on COPD patients showed that RNA expression of IL2RA, IFNgamma and related proinflammatory cytokines in blood serum did not correlate with a specific genotype. Although results presented in this study do not fully support our hypothesis, it is worth to mention that the identified genes/SNPs that were associated with either COPD or LC risk, all were involved in the activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor which is closely related to the regulation of the inflammatory response, a condition associated with both pathologies.
37460534 | NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibition potentiates the anti-myeloma activity of natural killer cells. Natural Killer (NK) cells act as important regulators in the development and progression of hematological malignancies and their suppressor activity against Multiple Myeloma (MM) cells has been confirmed in many studies. Significant changes in the distribution of NK cell subsets and dysfunctions of NK cell effector activities were described in MM patients and correlated with disease staging. Thus, restoring or enhancing the functionality of these effectors for the treatment of MM represents a critical need. Neddylation is a post-translational modification that adds a ubiquitin-like molecule, NEDD8, to the substrate protein. One of the outcomes is the activation of the Cullin Ring Ligases (CRLs), a class of ubiquitin-ligases that controls the degradation of about 20% of proteasome-regulated proteins. Overactivation of CRLs has been described in cancer and can lead to tumor growth and progression. Thus, targeting neddylation represents an attractive approach for cancer treatment. Our group has recently described how pharmacologic inhibition of neddylation increases the expression of the NKG2D activating receptor ligands, MICA and MICB, in MM cells, making these cells more susceptible to NK cell degranulation and killing. Here, we extended our investigation to the direct role of neddylation on NK cell effector functions exerted against MM. We observed that inhibition of neddylation enhanced NK cell-mediated degranulation and killing against MM cells and improved Daratumumab/Elotuzumab-mediated response. Mechanistically, inhibition of neddylation increased the expression of Rac1 and RhoA GTPases in NK cells, critical mediators for an efficient degranulation at the immunological synapse of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and augmented the levels of F-actin and perforin polarization in NK cells contacting target cells. Moreover, inhibition of neddylation partially abrogated TGFbeta-mediated repression of NK cell effector activity. This study describes the role of neddylation on NK cell effector functions and highlights the positive immunomodulatory effects achieved by the inhibition of this pathway in MM.
37672843 | Significant increase in MIC-A and MIC-B and soluble MIC-A and MIC-B in canine lymphomas. Non-Hodkin's lymphoma (NHL) is the most frequent hematologic malignancy in humans and dogs. NKG2D is one of the most critical receptors on NK cells, recognizing their natural ligands on malignant cells such as A and B major histocompatibility complex-related proteins (MIC-A and MIC-B). Soluble molecules (sMIC-A and sMIC-B) can interfere with immune synapsis between NK cells and tumor cells, impeding NK cytotoxicity. The main objectives of this study were to analyze, in dogs with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, NK cell lymphoma, and reactive lymphadenopathies, the role of NK cells, their activating receptors NKG2D and NKp46, and their ligands MIC-A and MIC-B, as well as soluble molecules sMIC-A and sMIC-B. Thirty-six dogs with a possible diagnosis of NHL and eight healthy dogs were studied. NHL was diagnosed in 28 (78 %) dogs; in the other 8 (22 %), reactive lymphadenopathies were present. Most of the lymphomas corresponded to B cell NHL (82 %). The most predominant subtype was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (21, 71.5 %), followed by five cases (18 %) that were Non-B Non-T lymphomas (presumably NK cell lymphomas) and other B cell lymphomas (3, 10.5%). There were no cases of T cell NHL. MIC-A was positive in 7 of 27 (26 %) cases of NHL, and MIC-B in 20 of 27 (74 %) NHL. In non-malignant lymphadenopathies, three (37.5 %) dogs were positive for MIC-A, and five (62.5 %) expressed MIC-B. Dogs with lymphoma had higher numbers of NK cells than eight healthy dogs. In 15 dogs (12 cases with NHL and three cases with reactive adenopathies) and eight controls, there were no differences in the number of NK cells expressing NKP46 and NKG2D. NHL dogs had higher values of sMIC-A and sMIC-B. B-cell and NK cell lymphomas correspond to 86 % and 14 % of all canine lymphomas. MIC-A, MIC-B, and sMIC-A and sMIC-B were increased in canine lymphomas.
37679517 | Integrating genomics and proteomics data to identify candidate plasma biomarkers for lung cancer risk among European descendants. BACKGROUND: Plasma proteins are potential biomarkers for complex diseases. We aimed to identify plasma protein biomarkers for lung cancer. METHODS: We investigated genetically predicted plasma levels of 1130 proteins in association with lung cancer risk among 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls of European descent. For proteins significantly associated with lung cancer risk, we evaluated associations of genetically predicted expression of their coding genes with the risk of lung cancer. RESULTS: Nine proteins were identified with genetically predicted plasma levels significantly associated with overall lung cancer risk at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05. Proteins C2, MICA, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with increased lung cancer risk, while proteins SFTPB, HLA-DQA2, MICB, NRP1, and GMFG were associated with decreased lung cancer risk. Stratified analyses by histological types revealed the cross-subtype consistency of these nine associations and identified an additional protein, ICAM5, significantly associated with lung adenocarcinoma risk (FDR < 0.05). Coding genes of NRP1 and ICAM5 proteins are located at two loci that have never been reported by previous GWAS. Genetically predicted blood levels of genes C2, AIF1, and CTSH were associated with lung cancer risk, in directions consistent with those shown in protein-level analyses. CONCLUSION: Identification of novel plasma protein biomarkers provided new insights into the biology of lung cancer.
37685962 | Targeting NKG2DL with Bispecific NKG2D-CD16 and NKG2D-CD3 Fusion Proteins on Triple-Negative Breast Cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a particularly aggressive subtype of breast cancer with a poor response rate to conventional systemic treatment and high relapse rates. Members of the natural killer group 2D ligand (NKG2DL) family are expressed on cancer cells but are typically absent from healthy tissues; thus, they are promising tumor antigens for novel immunotherapeutic approaches. We developed bispecific fusion proteins (BFPs) consisting of the NKG2D receptor domain targeting multiple NKG2DLs, fused to either anti-CD3 (NKG2D-CD3) or anti-CD16 (NKG2D-CD16) Fab fragments. First, we characterized the expression of the NKG2DLs (MICA, MICB, ULBP1-4) on TNBC cell lines and observed the highest surface expression for MICA and ULBP2. Targeting TNBC cells with NKG2D-CD3/CD16 efficiently activated both NK and T cells, leading to their degranulation and cytokine release and lysis of TNBC cells. Furthermore, PBMCs from TNBC patients currently undergoing chemotherapy showed significantly higher NK and T cell activation and tumor cell lysis when stimulated with NKG2D-CD3/CD16. In conclusions, BFPs activate and direct the NK and T cells of healthy and TNBC patients against TNBC cells, leading to efficient eradication of tumor cells. Therefore, NKG2D-based NK and T cell engagers could be a valuable addition to the treatment options for TNBC patients.
37966273 | Semi-mechanistic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling of a Plasmodium elongation factor 2 inhibitor cabamiquine for prevention and cure of malaria. Cabamiquine is a novel antimalarial agent that demonstrates the potential for chemoprevention and treatment of malaria. In this article, the dose-exposure-response relationship of cabamiquine was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) model, incorporating the effects of cabamiquine on parasite dynamics at the liver and blood stages of malaria infection. Modeling was performed sequentially. First, a three-compartmental population PK model was developed, comprising linear elimination, a transit absorption model in combination with first-order absorption, and a recirculation model. Second, this model was expanded into a PK/PD model using parasitemia data from an induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) human challenge model. To describe the parasite growth and killing in the blood, a turnover model was used. Finally, the liver stage parasite dynamics were characterized using data from a sporozoite challenge model (SpzCh), and system parameters were fixed based on biological plausibility. Cabamiquine concentration in the central compartment was used to drive parasite killing at the blood and liver stages. Blood stage minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICb) were estimated at 7.12 ng/mL [95% confidence interval (CI95%): 6.26-7.88 ng/mL] and 1.28 ng/mL (CI95%: 1.12-1.43 ng/mL) for IBSM and SpzCh populations, respectively, while liver stage MICl was lower (0.61 ng/mL; CI95%: 0.24-0.96 ng/mL). In conclusion, a population PK/PD model was developed by incorporating parasite dynamics and drug activity at the blood and liver stages based on clinical data and biological knowledge. This model can potentially facilitate antimalarial agent development by supporting the efficient selection of the optimal dosing regimen.
38345160 | Flow cytometry of DNMT1 as a biomarker of hypomethylating therapies. The 5-azacytidine (AZA) and decitabine (DEC) are noncytotoxic, differentiation-inducing therapies approved for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemias (AML), and under evaluation as maintenance therapy for AML postallogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and to treat hemoglobinapathies. Malignant cell cytoreduction is thought to occur by S-phase specific depletion of the key epigenetic regulator, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that, in the case of cancers, thereby releases terminal-differentiation programs. DNMT1-targeting can also elevate expression of immune function genes (HLA-DR, MICA, MICB) to stimulate graft versus leukemia effects. In vivo, there is a large inter-individual variability in DEC and 5-AZA activity because of pharmacogenetic factors, and an assay to quantify the molecular pharmacodynamic effect of DNMT1-depletion is a logical step toward individualized or personalized therapy. We developed and analytically validated a flow cytometric assay for DNMT1 epitope levels in blood and bone marrow cell subpopulations defined by immunophenotype and cell cycle state. Wild type (WT) and DNMT1 knock out (DKO) HC116 cells were used to select and optimize a highly specific DNMT1 monoclonal antibody. Methodologic validation of the assay consisted of cytometry and matching immunoblots of HC116-WT and -DKO cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells; flow cytometry of H116-WT treated with DEC, and patient samples before and after treatment with 5-AZA. Analysis of patient samples demonstrated assay reproducibility, variation in patient DNMT1 levels prior to treatment, and DNMT1 depletion posttherapy. A flow-cytometry assay has been developed that in the research setting of clinical trials can inform studies of DEC or 5-AZA treatment to achieve targeted molecular pharmacodynamic effects and better understand treatment-resistance/failure.
38575368 | Characterisation of RAET1E/ULBP4 exon 4 and 3' untranslated region genetic architecture reveals further diversity and allelic polymorphism. NKG2D is a natural killer cell activating receptor recognising ligands on infected or tumorigenic cells, leading to their cytolysis. There are eight known genes encoding NKG2D ligands: MICA, MICB and ULBP1-6. MICA and MICB are highly polymorphic and well characterised, whilst ULBP ligands are less polymorphic and the functional implication of their diversity is not well understood. Using International HLA and Immunogenetics Workshop (IHIW) cell line DNA, we previously characterised alleles of the RAET1E gene (encoding ULBP4 proteins), including the 5' UTR promoter region and exons 1-3. We found 11 promoter haplotypes associating with alleles based on exons 1-3, revealing 19 alleles overall. The current study extends this analysis using 87 individual DNA samples from IHIW cell lines or cord blood to include RAET1E exon 4 and the 3' UTR, as polymorphism in these regions have not been previously investigated. We found two novel exon 4 polymorphisms encoding amino acid substitutions altering the transmembrane domain. An amino acid substitution at residue 233 was unique to the RAET1E*008 allele whereas the substitution at residue 237 was shared between groups of alleles. Additionally, four haplotypes were found based on 3' UTR sequences, which were unique to certain alleles or shared with allele groups based on exons 1-4 polymorphisms. Furthermore, putative microRNAs were identified that may interact with these polymorphic sites, repressing transcription and potentially affecting expression levels.
38627665 | Pan-inhibition of the three H2S synthesizing enzymes restrains tumor progression and immunosuppression in breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a significant endogenous mediator that has been implicated in the progression of various forms of cancer including breast cancer (BC). Cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3MST) are the three principal mammalian enzymes responsible for H2S production. Overexpression of CBS, CSE and 3MST was found to be associated with poor prognosis of BC patients. Moreover, H2S was linked to an immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment in BC. Recently it was observed that BC cells, in response to single or dual inhibition of H2S synthesizing enzymes, develop an escape mechanism by overexpressing alternative sources of H2S generation. Thus, the aim of this work is to escape the H2S compensatory mechanism by pan repressing the three enzymes using microRNAs (miRNAs) and to investigate their impact on the oncogenic and immunogenic profile of BC cells. METHODS: BC female patients (n = 25) were recruited. In-silico analysis was used to identify miRNAs targeting CBS, CSE, and 3MST. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured and transfected using oligonucleotides. Total RNA was extracted using Biazol, reverse transcribed and quantified using qRT-PCR. H2S levels were measured using AzMc assay. BC hallmarks were assessed using trans-well migration, wound healing, MTT, and colony forming assays. RESULTS: miR-193a and miR-548c were validated by eight different bioinformatics software to simultaneously target CBS, CSE and 3MST. MiR-193a and miR-548c were significantly downregulated in BC tissues compared to their non-cancerous counterparts. Ectopic expression of miR-193a and miR-548c in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells resulted in a marked repression of CBS, CSE, and 3MST transcript and protein levels, a significant decrease in H2S levels, reduction in cellular viability, inhibition of migration and colony forming ability, repression of immune-suppressor proteins GAL3 GAL9, and CD155 and upregulation of the immunostimulatory MICA and MICB proteins. CONCLUSION: This study sheds the light onto miR-193a and miR-548c as potential pan-repressors of the H2S synthesizing enzymes. and identifies them as novel tumor suppressor and immunomodulatory miRNAs in TNBC.
38630551 | Efficacy of pembrolizumab and biomarker analysis in patients with WGS-based intermediate to high tumor mutational load: results from the Drug Rediscovery Protocol. PURPOSE: To evaluate efficacy of pembrolizumab across multiple cancer types harboring different levels of Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS)-based tumor mutational load (TML; total of non-synonymous mutations across the genome) in patients included in the Drug Rediscovery Protocol (NCT02925234). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with solid, treatment-refractory, microsatellite-stable tumors were enrolled in cohort A: breast cancer TML 140-290, cohort B: tumor-agnostic cohort TML 140-290, and cohort C: tumor-agnostic cohort TML >290. Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg every three weeks. Primary endpoint was clinical benefit (CB: objective response or stable disease (SD) >=16 weeks). Pre-treatment tumor biopsies were obtained for WGS and RNA-sequencing. RESULTS: Seventy-two evaluable patients with 26 different histotypes were enrolled. CB rate was 13% in cohort A (3/24 with partial response (PR)), 21% in cohort B (3/24 with SD, 2/24 with PR), and 42% in cohort C (4/24 with SD, 6/24 with PR). In cohort C, neoantigen burden estimates and expression of inflammation and innate immune biomarkers were significantly associated with CB. Similar associations were not identified in cohort A and B. In cohort A, CB was significantly associated with mutations in the chromatin remodeling gene PBRM1, while in cohort B, CB was significantly associated with expression of MICA/MICB and butyrophilins. CB and clonal TML were not significantly associated. CONCLUSION: While in cohort A pembrolizumab lacked activity, cohort B and cohort C met the study's primary endpoint. Further research is warranted to refine selection of patients with tumors harboring lower TMLs and may benefit from a focus on innate immunity.
10037026 | Differential substrate recognition capabilities of Janus family protein tyrosine kinases within the interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) system: Jak3 as a potential molecular target for treatment of leukemias with a hyperactive Jak-Stat signaling machinery. Substrate recognition by Janus family protein tyrosine kinases was examined utilizing recombinant baculovirus produced components of the interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) system i.e. Jak1, Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT). Wild type Jak3 was able to tyrosine phosphorylate a kinase-dead Jak1 (Jak1E908). In contrast wild type Jak1 was unable to tyrosine phosphorylate kinase dead Jak3 (Jak3E851). This unilateral transphosphorylation between Jak3 and Jak1 prompts the hypothesis that in the IL2R system the activation of Jak3 precedes Jak1 activation. Both the IL2Rbeta and IL2Rgammac subunits underwent tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed with wild-type Jak3. By comparison only IL2Rbeta was recognized and tyrosine phosphorylated by wild-type Jak1. These results are consistent with the notion that Jakl is pre-associated with IL2Rbeta and Jak3 is pre-associated with IL2Rgammac. STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 underwent tyrosine phosphorylation when co-expressed with Jakl and therefore are substrates for the respective Jak kinases. In contrast, Jak3 co-expression resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT5 but not STAT1. Notably a polypeptide representing the kinase domain of Jak3 (Jak3-JH1) gained the ability to tyrosine phosphorylate STAT1, suggesting that the changes in substrate recognition may be influenced by domains outside the kinase domain. These findings provide evidence that Jak1 and Jak3 differentially recognize specific substrates, thereby having the ability to contribute specific signals, and the substrate specificity may be influenced by multiple domains of these tyrosine kinases.
10383053 | Signal transduction pathways induced by GM-CSF in microglia: significance in the control of proliferation. Communication between cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and of the immune system is accomplished by a network of cytokines and growth factors. Certain cytokines and growth factors cause activation of microglia, contributing to inflammatory states in the CNS. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has numerous effects on microglia, ranging from induction of proliferation to changes in morphology. GM-CSF is also a growth factor for cells of the myeloid lineage, and the signal tranduction induced by GM-CSF in these cells has been extensively studied. Most notably, the importance of the Jak/STAT and MAP kinase pathways in mitogenesis has been shown in many different systems. We show here that primary microglia and a microglia cell line, BV-2, have a Jak/STAT expression pattern and GM-CSF inducibility similar to that of monocytes and macrophages. Primary microglia and BV-2 cells expressed identical Jak/STATs: Jakl, Jak2, Jak3, Tyk2, STAT1alpha/beta, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, and STAT6. In addition, GM-CSF induced Jak2, STAT5A, and STAT5B in BV-2 cells, as it does in monocytes and macrophages. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that STAT5 translocates to the nucleus following GM-CSF stimulation of microglia. We also found the MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2, to be phosphorylated in microglia and BV-2 cells following induction by GM-CSF. Jak2, STAT5A, STAT5B, and ERKs are known to be important in controlling cellular proliferation. Drugs that block these pathways may become tools to control inflammation in the CNS by limiting microglial proliferation.
10612665 | Epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen-1 binds to nuclear transporter karyopherin alpha1/NPI-1 in addition to karyopherin alpha2/Rch1. We searched for cellular proteins that interact with Epstein-Barr (EBV) virus nuclear antigen-1, which is a latent EBV origin-binding protein detected in all EBV latently infected cells and essential for maintenance of the latent EBV genome, by a yeast two-hybrid screening of a B lymphocyte cDNA library in this study. Interaction of polypeptides synthesized from three selected cDNA clones with EBNA-1 proteins was confirmed in vitro using their glutathione-S-transferase-fusion polypeptides and by coimmunoprecipitation analyses of B cell extracts with anti-EBNA-1 monoclonal antibodies and monospecific antibodies against cellular proteins of interest. We report the following: (i) Karyopherin alpha (karyopherin alpha1, hSRP1, and NPI-1), an adaptor subunit of nuclear localization signal receptors, which direct proteins to the nuclear pore, interacted with EBNA-1. (ii) EBNA-1 proteins endogenous in the B cell line Raji of Burkitt lymphoma origin bound to another adaptor protein, karyopherin alpha2 (hSRP1alpha, hRch1), interactions of which to recombinant EBNA-1 polypeptides were previously reported. (iii) Nearly 90% of all the cDNA clones examined was p32 (SF2-associated P32, p32/TAP, and gC1q-R), and endogenous EBNA-1 proteins in the Raji cells bound to p32, a potential of which to affect localization of EBNA-1 in transfected Vero cells has been recently suggested. These results suggest that EBNA-1, which has the unique NLS containing Lys-Arg and overlapping with one of the phosphorylation domains, is recognized and transported to the nuclei by these two distinct karyopherin alpha proteins, which are differentially expressed in different cell types, implying a regulatory localization system for EBNA-1.
17682048 | p32 is a novel mammalian Lgl binding protein that enhances the activity of protein kinase Czeta and regulates cell polarity. Lgl (lethal giant larvae) plays an important role in cell polarity. Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) binds to and phosphorylates Lgl, and the phosphorylation negatively regulates Lgl activity. In this study, we identify p32 as a novel Lgl binding protein that directly binds to a domain on mammalian Lgl2 (mLgl2), which contains the aPKC phosphorylation site. p32 also binds to PKCzeta, and the three proteins form a transient ternary complex. When p32 is bound, PKCzeta is stimulated to phosphorylate mLgl2 more efficiently. p32 overexpression in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells cultured in a 3D matrix induces an expansion of the actin-enriched apical membrane domain and disrupts cell polarity. Addition of PKCzeta inhibitor blocks apical actin accumulation, which is rescued by p32 overexpression. p32 knockdown by short hairpin RNA also induces cell polarity defects. Collectively, our data indicate that p32 is a novel regulator of cell polarity that forms a complex with mLgl2 and aPKC and enhances aPKC activity.
17959680 | Identification of human cytomegalovirus UL84 virus- and cell-encoded binding partners by using proteomics analysis. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL84 is a phosphoprotein that shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and is required for oriLyt-dependent DNA replication and viral growth. UL84 was previously shown to interact with IE2 (IE86) in infected cells, and this interaction down-regulates IE2-mediated transcriptional activation in transient assays. UL84 and IE2 were also shown to cooperatively activate a promoter within HCMV oriLyt. UL84 alone can interact with an RNA stem-loop within oriLyt and is bound to this structure within the virion. In an effort to investigate the binding partners for UL84 in infected cells, we pulled down UL84 from protein lysates prepared from HCMV-infected human fibroblasts by using a UL84-specific antibody and resolved the immunoprecipitated protein complexes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We subsequently identified individual proteins by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-tandem time of flight analysis. This analysis revealed that UL84 interacts with viral proteins UL44, pp65, and IE2. In addition, a number of cell-encoded proteins were identified, including ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, casein kinase II (CKII), and the multifunctional protein p32. We also confirmed the interaction between UL84 and IE2 as well as the interaction of UL84 with importin alpha. UL44, pp65, and CKII interactions were confirmed to occur in infected and cotransfected cells by coimmunoprecipitation assays followed by Western blotting. Ubiquitination of UL84 occurred in the presence and absence of the proteasome activity inhibitor MG132 in infected cells. The identification of UL84 binding partners is a significant step toward the understanding of the function of this significant replication protein.
19257508 | Indications of conical emission of charged hadrons at the BNL relativistic heavy ion collider. Three-particle azimuthal correlation measurements with a high transverse momentum trigger particle are reported for pp, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=200 GeV by the STAR experiment. Dijet structures are observed in pp, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions. An additional structure is observed in central Au+Au data, signaling conical emission of correlated charged hadrons. The conical emission angle is found to be theta=1.37+/-0.02(stat)-0.07+0.06(syst), independent of p_{ perpendicular}.
19392193 | Observation of two-source interference in the photoproduction reaction AuAu --> AuAurho0. In ultraperipheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a photon from the electromagnetic field of one nucleus can fluctuate to a quark-antiquark pair and scatter from the other nucleus, emerging as a rho{0}. The rho{0} production occurs in two well-separated (median impact parameters of 20 and 40 F for the cases considered here) nuclei, so the system forms a two-source interferometer. At low transverse momenta, the two amplitudes interfere destructively, suppressing rho{0} production. Since the rho{0} decays before the production amplitudes from the two sources can overlap, the two-pion system can only be described with an entangled nonlocal wave function, and is thus an example of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox. We observe this suppression in 200 GeV per nucleon-pair gold-gold collisions. The interference is 87%+/-5%(stat.)+/-8%(syst.) of the expected level. This translates into a limit on decoherence due to wave function collapse or other factors of 23% at the 90% confidence level.
19655172 | STAT6 activation by Toxoplasma gondii infection induces the expression of Th2 C-C chemokine ligands and B clade serine protease inhibitors in macrophage. Toxoplasma gondii provoked rapid and sustained nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6, a central mediator of interleukin (IL)-4, in macrophage-differentiated human acute monocytic leukemia cells without exogenous IL-4 in western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Phosphorylation of STAT6 occurred immediately after the entry of T. gondii and only by live tachyzoites, not by killed or soluble extract. It was impeded by Janus kinase (JAK) 3 inhibitor and small interfering RNA (siRNA) of STAT6. It induced expression of IL-4 responsive genes such as IL-4R, CD40, and CD23. It also mediated expression of two large clusters of C-C chemokine ligands (CCLs) and serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs) in microarray of T. gondii-infected macrophages. CCL1, 2, 8, 13, and 22 and SPINT2, SERPINB3, B4, and B13 were increased by the infection and inhibited by the treatment of JAK3 inhibitor and siRNA-mediated STAT6 silencing, which suggested the expression was governed by STAT6 activation. Secreting those CCLs, T. gondii-infected macrophages may attract more monocytes and Th2 cells of CCR3 and CCR4 to enrich the Th2 environment nearby the infected macrophages, and induced SERPINs may participate in protection from intracellular damages produced by activated lysosomal enzymes and in the inhibition of caspase activity to block the apoptosis. This suggests that T. gondii exploits cytokine cross-regulation through STAT6 activation to obviate various toxoplasmacidal reactions by interferon-gamma.
19812686 | Tumor-shed PGE(2) impairs IL2Rgammac-signaling to inhibit CD4 T cell survival: regulation by theaflavins. BACKGROUND: Many tumors are associated with decreased cellular immunity and elevated levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a known inhibitor of CD4+ T cell activation and inducer of type-2 cytokine bias. However, the role of this immunomodulator in the survival of T helper cells remained unclear. Since CD4+ T cells play critical roles in cell-mediated immunity, detail knowledge of the effect tumor-derived PGE2 might have on CD4+ T cell survival and the underlying mechanism may, therefore, help to overcome the overall immune deviation in cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By culturing purified human peripheral CD4+ T cells or Jurkat cells with spent media of theaflavin- or celecoxib-pre-treated MCF-7 cells, we show that tumor-shed PGE2 severely impairs interleukin 2 receptor gammac (IL2Rgammac)-mediated survival signaling in CD4+ T cells. Indeed, tumor-shed PGE2 down-regulates IL2Rgammac expression, reduces phosphorylation as well as activation of Janus kinase 3 (Jak-3)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat-5) and decreases Bcl-2/Bax ratio thereby leading to activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Constitutively active Stat-5A (Stat-5A1 6) over-expression efficiently elevates Bcl-2 levels in CD4+ T cells and protects them from tumor-induced death while dominant-negative Stat-5A over-expression fails to do so, indicating the importance of Stat-5A-signaling in CD4+ T cell survival. Further support towards the involvement of PGE2 comes from the results that (a) purified synthetic PGE2 induces CD4+ T cell apoptosis, and (b) when knocked out by small interfering RNA, cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2)-defective tumor cells fail to initiate death. Interestingly, the entire phenomena could be reverted back by theaflavins that restore cytokine-dependent IL2Rgammac/Jak-3/Stat-5A signaling in CD4+ T cells thereby protecting them from tumor-shed PGE2-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data strongly suggest that tumor-shed PGE2 is an important factor leading to CD4+ T cell apoptosis during cancer and raise the possibility that theaflavins may have the potential as an effective immunorestorer in cancer-bearer.
20853320 | Differential survival of gammadeltaT cells, alphabetaT cells and NK cells upon engagement of NKG2D by NKG2DL-expressing leukemic cells. Herein, we show that gammadeltaT, CD8(+) alphabetaT lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells display a different sensitivity to survival signals delivered via NKG2D surface receptor. All the three effector cell populations activate Akt1/PKBalpha through the engagement of this molecule. Upon binding to leukemic cells expressing NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including chronic lymphocytic leukemias treated with transretinoic acid, most gammadeltaT (>60%) and half CD8(+) alphabetaT cells (about 50%) received a survival signal, at variance with the majority of NK cells (>80%) that underwent apoptosis by day 5. Interestingly, oligomerization of NKG2D in gammadeltaT or CD8(+) alphabetaT cells, led to a significant rise in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of both NF-kBp52 and RelB, the two NF-kB subunits mainly involved in the transcription of antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl family. Indeed, the ratio between the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) and the proapoptotic protein Bax raised in gammadeltaT or CD8(+) alphabetaT cells following NKG2D engagement by specific monoclonal antibodies or by NKG2DL expressing leukemic cells. Conversely, nuclear translocation of NF-kBp52 or RelB did not increase, nor the Bcl-2/Bax or the Bcl-x(L) /Bax ratios changed significantly, in NK cells upon oligomerizaton of NKG2D. Of note, transcripts for alpha5 importin, responsible for nuclear translocation of NF-kBp52/Rel B heterodimer, are significantly higher in gammadeltaT and CD8(+) alphabetaT cells than in NK cells. These biochemical data may explain, at least in part, why gammadeltaT and CD8(+) alphabetaT cells are cytolytic effector cells more resistant to target-induced apoptosis than NK cells.
21228752 | Inhibition of nuclear translocation of calcineurin suppresses T-cell activation and prevents acute rejection of donor hearts. BACKGROUND: Inhibition of calcineurin (CnA) activity by cyclosporine A (CsA) is the mainstay in immunosuppressive therapy. CsA inhibits the phosphatase activity of the cytosolic phosphatase CnA and, therefore, prevents the dephosphorylation and subsequently nuclear translocation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). However, CsA has multiple other targets within the cell and is, therefore, not specific. We developed a new approach to inhibit CnA/NFAT signaling. This synthetic peptide prevented CnA nuclear translocation in vitro. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that this novel approach could potentially inhibit T-cell function in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: T-cell activation (Jurkat T cells, naive rat T cells, and peripheral human T cells) was assessed by protein synthesis, interleukin (IL)-2 promoter activity, and IL-2 levels after T-cell activation. Immunohistological stainings for CnA were performed to investigate nuclear localization of CnA. The immunosuppressive effects in vivo of the synthetic peptide were investigated in rats with heterotopic transplanted hearts. RESULTS: The nuclear localization signal peptide significantly decreased alloantigen-specific T-lymphocyte proliferation, IL-2 promoter activity, and IL-2 production (338% +- 27% vs. 149% +- 11%, n=8, P<0.05) in cultured T cells by inhibition of CnA nuclear translocation. The synthetic peptide also significantly decreased the number of graft infiltrating CD8 T lymphocytes. Moreover, treatment with the synthetic inhibitory inhibited acute graft rejection (5 +- 0.6 days vs. 12 +- 2 days, n=10, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of nuclear translocation of CnA is a novel approach to inhibit the activation of the CnA/NFAT signaling cascade. Further studies have to demonstrate the long-term use of this principle in vivo.
21844139 | Influence of Janus kinase inhibition on interleukin 6-mediated induction of acute-phase serum amyloid A in rheumatoid synovium. OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of intracellular signal transduction is considered to be a therapeutic target for chronic inflammation. The new Janus kinase (JAK)3 inhibitor CP690,550 has shown efficacy in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated the influence of JAK/STAT inhibition using CP690,550 on the induction of acute-phase serum amyloid A (SAA), which is triggered by interleukin 6 (IL-6) stimulation in rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS). METHODS: IL-6-stimulated gene expression of the acute-phase serum amyloid A genes (A-SAA; encoded by SAA1+SAA2) and SAA4 was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The intracellular signaling pathway mediating the effects of CP690,550 on IL-6-stimulated JAK/STAT activation was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation levels using Western blots. RESULTS: IL-6 trans-signaling induced A-SAA messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in RA-FLS. By contrast IL-6 stimulation did not affect SAA4 mRNA expression, which is expressed constitutively in RA-FLS. IL-6 stimulation elicited rapid phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, which was blunted by CP690,550. CP690,550 abrogated IL-6-mediated A-SAA mRNA expression in RA-FLS. Similarly, CP690,550 inhibited IL-6-mediated A-SAA mRNA expression in human hepatocytes. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that CP690,550 blocked IL-6-induced JAK2/STAT3 activation, as well as the induction of A-SAA. Inhibition of IL-6-mediated proinflammatory signaling pathways by CP690,550 may represent a new antiinflammatory therapeutic strategy for RA and AA amyloidosis.
23968543 | Inhibition of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling pathway in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts using small molecule compounds. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have been developed as anti-inflammatory agents and have demonstrated clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated if JAK-3-selective inhibition alone could disrupt cytokine signalling in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. In-vitro studies were performed using synovial fibroblasts isolated from patients with RA. Levels of activated JAK and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis. Target-gene expression levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time PCR. The JAK inhibitors CP-690,550 and INCB028050 both suppressed activation of JAK-1/-2/-3 and downstream STAT-1/-3/-5, as well as the expression levels of target proinflammatory genes (MCP-I, SAA1/2) in oncostatin-M (OSM)-stimulated rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. In contrast, the JAK-3-selective inhibitor, PF-956980, suppressed STAT-1/-5 activation but did not affect STAT-3 activation in OSM-stimulated rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. In addition, PF-956980 significantly suppressed MCP-1 gene expression, but did not block SAA1/2 gene expression in OSM-stimulated rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts. These data suggest that JAK-3-selective inhibition alone is insufficient to control STAT-3-dependent signalling in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, and inhibition of JAKs, including JAK-1/-2, is needed to control the proinflammatory cascade in RA. 
24216307 | Two nuclear export signals of Cdc6 are differentially associated with CDK-mediated phosphorylation residues for cytoplasmic translocation. Cdc6 is cleaved at residues 442 and 290 by caspase-3 during apoptosis producing p49-tCdc6 and p32-tCdc6, respectively. While p32-tCdc6 is unable to translocate into the cytoplasm, p49-tCdc6 retains cytoplasmic translocation activity, but it has a lower efficiency than wild-type Cdc6. We hypothesized that a novel nuclear export signal (NES) sequence exists between amino acids 290 and 442. Cdc6 contains a novel NES in the region of amino acids 300-315 (NES2) that shares sequence similarity with NES1 at residues 462-476. In mutant versions of Cdc6, we replaced leucine with alanine in NES1 and NES2 and co-expressed the mutant constructs with cyclin A. We observed that the cytoplasmic translocation of these mutants was reduced in comparison to wild-type Cdc6. Moreover, the cytoplasmic translocation of a mutant in which all four leucine residues were mutated to alanine was significantly inhibited in comparison to the translocation of wild-type Cdc6. The Crm1 binding activities of Cdc6 NES mutants were consistent with the efficiency of its cytoplasmic translocation. Further studies have revealed that L468 and L470 of NES1 are required for cytoplasmic translocation of Cdc6 phosphorylated at S74, while L311 and L313 of NES2 accelerate the cytoplasmic translocation of Cdc6 phosphorylated at S54. These results suggest that the two NESs of Cdc6 work cooperatively and distinctly for the cytoplasmic translocation of Cdc6 phosphorylated at S74 and S54 by cyclin A/Cdk2. 
24335104 | Mutation of NRAS but not KRAS significantly reduces myeloma sensitivity to single-agent bortezomib therapy. Various translocations and mutations have been identified in myeloma, and certain aberrations, such as t(4;14) and del17, are linked with disease prognosis. To investigate mutational prevalence in myeloma and associations between mutations and patient outcomes, we tested a panel of 41 known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in tumor samples from 133 relapsed myeloma patients participating in phase 2 or 3 clinical trials of bortezomib. DNA mutations were identified in 14 genes. BRAF as well as RAS genes were mutated in a large proportion of cases (45.9%) and these mutations were mutually exclusive. New recurrent mutations were also identified, including in the PDGFRA and JAK3 genes. NRAS mutations were associated with a significantly lower response rate to single-agent bortezomib (7% vs 53% in patients with mutant vs wild-type NRAS, P = .00116, Bonferroni-corrected P = .016), as well as shorter time to progression in bortezomib-treated patients (P = .0058, Bonferroni-corrected P = .012). However, NRAS mutation did not impact outcome in patients treated with high-dose dexamethasone. KRAS mutation did not reduce sensitivity to bortezomib or dexamethasone. These findings identify a significant clinical impact of NRAS mutation in myeloma and demonstrate a clear example of functional differences between the KRAS and NRAS oncogenes. 
24877754 | The molecular mechanism of curcumol on inducing cell growth arrest and apoptosis in Jurkat cells, a model of CD4+ T cells. CD4(+) T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) express growth signaling pathway in association with deregulated growth and resistance to apoptosis. The janus kinase (Jak) 3 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway play a critical role in interleukin-2 (IL-2)-induced CD4(+) T cell proliferation. The present study aimed to explore the anti-cell proliferation mechanism of curcumol, a pure monomer extracted from Chinese medical plant Rhizoma curcumae. Cell proliferation was determined using WST-1 assay after curcumol treatment. The cell cycle distribution and Bcl-2 protein expression were assessed by flow cytometry. The cellular morphology of apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33258 staining. The expressions of phosphorylated-Jak3 (p-Jak3), p-STAT3, and p-STAT5a following IL-2 stimulation were determined by western blot analysis. The Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay was used to detect the DNA binding activities of transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5. The study results showed that curcumol could inhibit the IL-2-induced Jurkat cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in vitro. Curcumol could cause cell cycle arrest at the S phase, induce cell apoptosis, and inhibit the expression of Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumol at 50mug/mL and Jak3 inhibitor ZM39923 could inhibit the phosphorylation of Jak3 and STAT5a. In conclusion, the underlying mechanism of curcumol on suppressing CD4(+) T cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis might partly be mediated by inhibition of Jak3-STAT5-related molecular activities and Bcl-2 expression, respectively; further studies are required in vivo to test the use of curcumol as a promising therapeutic option for RA.
27328359 | Nuclear trafficking of the anti-apoptotic Coxiella burnetii effector protein AnkG requires binding to p32 and Importin-alpha1. The obligate intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii causes the zoonotic disease Q-fever. Coxiella pathogenesis depends on a functional type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS effector AnkG inhibits pathogen-induced host cell apoptosis, which is believed to be important for the establishment of a persistent infection. However, the mode of action of AnkG is not fully understood. We have previously demonstrated that binding of AnkG to p32 is crucial for migration of AnkG into the nucleus and that nuclear localization of AnkG is essential for its anti-apoptotic activity. Here, we compared the activity of AnkG from the C. burnetii strains Nine Mile and Dugway. Although there is only a single amino acid exchange at residue 11, we observed a difference in anti-apoptotic activity and nuclear migration. Mutation of amino acid 11 to glutamic acid, threonine or valine results in AnkG mutants that had lost the anti-apoptotic activity and the ability to migrate into the nucleus. We identified Importin-alpha1 to bind to AnkG, but not to the mutants and concluded that binding of AnkG to p32 and Importin-alpha1 is essential for migration into the nucleus. Also during Coxiella infection binding of AnkG to p32 and Importin-alpha1 is crucial for nuclear localization of AnkG.
28128670 | Large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and novel treatment options. INTRODUCTION: Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) is a low grade lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the clonal proliferation of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and recognised by the WHO. The diagnosis and management of these patients is challenging due to the limited information from prospective studies. Guidelines for front-line therapy have not been established. The prognosis is favourable with median overall survivals greater than 10 years. Areas covered: This manuscript is a review of the clinical features, diagnosis, pathogenesis and, in particular, the various available therapeutic options for this rare lymphoid leukemia. A systematic literature search using electronic PubMed database has been carried out. Expert commentary: A watch and wait strategy without therapeutic intervention is recommended in asymptomatic patients. The immunomodulators methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin are the most commonly used drugs in the routine practice with responses ranging from 50 to 65% and without evidence of cross-resistance among them. Purine analogs such as 2 deoxycoformycin and fludarabine alone or in combination may be indicated in patients with bulky and/or widespread disease. Trials using monoclonal antibodies such as Alemtuzumab and agents targeting the disrupted JAK/STAT pathway in LGLL such as JAK-3 inhibitors are promising particularly in a relapse setting.
29038115 | The Common Cytokine Receptor gamma Chain Family of Cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 form a family of cytokines based on their sharing the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac), which was originally discovered as the third receptor component of the IL-2 receptor, IL-2Rgamma. The IL2RG gene is located on the X chromosome and is mutated in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). The breadth of the defects in XSCID could not be explained solely by defects in IL-2 signaling, and it is now clear that gammac is a shared receptor component of the six cytokines noted above, making XSCID a disease of defective cytokine signaling. Janus kinase (JAK)3 associates with gammac, and JAK3-deficient SCID phenocopies XSCID, findings that served to stimulate the development of JAK3 inhibitors as immunosuppressants. gammac family cytokines collectively control broad aspects of lymphocyte development, growth, differentiation, and survival, and these cytokines are clinically important, related to allergic and autoimmune diseases and cancer as well as immunodeficiency. In this review, we discuss the actions of these cytokines, their critical biological roles and signaling pathways, focusing mainly on JAK/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling, and how this information is now being used in clinical therapeutic efforts.
29670170 | Y-box protein-associated acidic protein (YBAP1/C1QBP) affects the localization and cytoplasmic functions of YB-1. The Y-box proteins are multifunctional nucleic acid-binding proteins involved in various aspects of gene regulation. The founding member of the Y-box protein family, YB-1, functions as a transcription factor as well as a principal component of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) in somatic cells. The nuclear level of YB-1 is well correlated with poor prognosis in many human cancers. Previously, we showed that a Y-box protein-associated acidic protein, YBAP1, which is identical to complement component 1, q subcomponent-binding protein (C1QBP, also called gC1qR, hyaluronan-binding protein 1 [HABP1] or ASF/SF2-associated protein p32), relieves translational repression by YB-1. Here we show that the nuclear localization of YB-1 harboring a point mutation in the cold shock domain was inhibited when co-expressed with YBAP1, whereas cytoplasmic accumulation of the wild-type YB-1 was not affected. We showed that YBAP1 inhibited the interaction between YB-1 and transportin 1. In the cytoplasm, YBAP1 affected the accumulation of YB-1 to processing bodies (P-bodies) and partially abrogated the mRNA stabilization by YB-1. Our results, indicating that YBAP1/C1QBP regulates the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of YB-1 and its cytoplasmic functions, are consistent with a model that YBAP1/C1QBP acts as an mRNP remodeling factor.
29932316 | [Research progress of JAK-3 kinase and its inhibitors]. JAK-3, a member of the Janus kinase family, is a protein tyrosine kinase, which plays an important role in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Previous studies showed that regulation of JAK-3's activity plays a crucial role in the treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Many reports have been published with a focus on selective JAK-3 inhibitors, some of which showed excellent JAK-3 selectivity and inhibitory activities. Among the JAK-3 inhibitors reported, tofacitinib has satisfactory therapeutic benefits in the clinical trials, and has been approved for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, some JAK-3 inhibitors exhibited moderate to severe side effects, which need to be controlled by drug improvement. In order to pave the way for improvement of current JAK-3 inhibitors and development of new JAK-3 inhibitors, we provide an outline of the structure of JAK-3 and strategies in development of its inhibitors.
30814284 | Vaccinia Virus BBK E3 Ligase Adaptor A55 Targets Importin-Dependent NF-kappaB Activation and Inhibits CD8+ T-Cell Memory. Viral infection of cells is sensed by pathogen recognition receptors that trigger an antiviral innate immune response, and consequently viruses have evolved countermeasures. Vaccinia virus (VACV) evades the host immune response by expressing scores of immunomodulatory proteins. One family of VACV proteins are the BTB-BACK (broad-complex, tram-trac, and bric-a-brac [BTB] and C-terminal Kelch [BACK]) domain-containing, Kelch-like (BBK) family of predicted cullin-3 E3 ligase adaptors: A55, C2, and F3. Previous studies demonstrated that gene A55R encodes a protein that is nonessential for VACV replication yet affects viral virulence in vivo Here, we report that A55 is an NF-kappaB inhibitor acting downstream of IkappaBalpha degradation, preventing gene transcription and cytokine secretion in response to cytokine stimulation. A55 targets the host importin alpha1 (KPNA2), acting to reduce p65 binding and its nuclear translocation. Interestingly, while A55 was confirmed to coprecipitate with cullin-3 in a BTB-dependent manner, its NF-kappaB inhibitory activity mapped to the Kelch domain, which alone is sufficient to coprecipitate with KPNA2 and inhibit NF-kappaB signaling. Intradermal infection of mice with a virus lacking A55R (vDeltaA55) increased VACV-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity in comparison to levels of the wild-type (WT) virus. Furthermore, immunization with vDeltaA55 induced increased protection to intranasal VACV challenge compared to the level with control viruses. In summary, this report describes the first target of a poxvirus-encoded BBK protein and a novel mechanism for DNA virus immune evasion, resulting in increased CD8+ T-cell memory and a more immunogenic vaccine.IMPORTANCE NF-kappaB is a critical transcription factor in the innate immune response to infection and in shaping adaptive immunity. The identification of host and virus proteins that modulate the induction of immunological memory is important for improving virus-based vaccine design and efficacy. In viruses, the expression of BTB-BACK Kelch-like (BBK) proteins is restricted to poxviruses and conserved within them, indicating the importance of these proteins for these medically important viruses. Using vaccinia virus (VACV), the smallpox vaccine, we report that the VACV BBK protein A55 dysregulates NF-kappaB signaling by disrupting the p65-importin interaction, thus preventing NF-kappaB translocation and blocking NF-kappaB-dependent gene transcription. Infection with VACV lacking A55 induces increased VACV-specific CD8+ T-cell memory and better protection against VACV challenge. Studying viral immunomodulators therefore expands not only our understanding of viral pathogenesis and immune evasion strategies but also of the immune signaling cascades controlling antiviral immunity and the development of immune memory.
31774393 | The Wolbachia cytoplasmic incompatibility enzyme CidB targets nuclear import and protamine-histone exchange factors. Intracellular Wolbachia bacteria manipulate arthropod reproduction to promote their own inheritance. The most prevalent mechanism, cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), traces to a Wolbachia deubiquitylase, CidB, and CidA. CidB has properties of a toxin, while CidA binds CidB and rescues embryonic viability. CidB is also toxic to yeast where we identified both host effects and high-copy suppressors of toxicity. The strongest suppressor was karyopherin-alpha, a nuclear-import receptor; this required nuclear localization-signal binding. A protein-interaction screen of Drosophila extracts using a substrate-trapping catalytic mutant, CidB*, also identified karyopherin-alpha; the P32 protamine-histone exchange factor bound as well. When CidB* bound CidA, these host protein interactions disappeared. These associations would place CidB at the zygotic male pronucleus where CI defects first manifest. Overexpression of karyopherin-alpha, P32, or CidA in female flies suppressed CI. We propose that CidB targets nuclear-protein import and protamine-histone exchange and that CidA rescues embryos by restricting CidB access to its targets.
31799703 | The IL-2RG R328X nonsense mutation allows partial STAT-5 phosphorylation and defines a critical region involved in the leaky-SCID phenotype. In addition to their detection in typical X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, hypomorphic mutations in the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor common gamma chain gene (IL2RG) have been described in patients with atypical clinical and immunological phenotypes. In this leaky clinical phenotype the diagnosis is often delayed, limiting prompt therapy in these patients. Here, we report the biochemical and functional characterization of a nonsense mutation in exon 8 (p.R328X) of IL2RG in two siblings: a 4-year-old boy with lethal Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoma and his asymptomatic 8-month-old brother with a Tlow B+ natural killer (NK)+ immunophenotype, dysgammaglobulinemia, abnormal lymphocyte proliferation and reduced levels of T cell receptor excision circles. After confirming normal IL-2RG expression (CD132) on T lymphocytes, signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-5) phosphorylation was examined to evaluate the functionality of the common gamma chain (gammac ), which showed partially preserved function. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to assess the interaction capacity of the R328X mutant with Janus kinase (JAK)3, concluding that R328X impairs JAK3 binding to gammac . Here, we describe how the R328X mutation in IL-2RG may allow partial phosphorylation of STAT-5 through a JAK3-independent pathway. We identified a region of three amino acids in the gammac intracellular domain that may be critical for receptor stabilization and allow this alternative signaling. Identification of the functional consequences of pathogenic IL2RG variants at the cellular level is important to enable clearer understanding of partial defects leading to leaky phenotypes.
32646440 | MKL-1 is a coactivator for STAT5b, the regulator of Treg cell development and function. BACKGROUND: Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg) constitutes a key event in autoimmune diseases. STAT5b is the critical link between the IL-2/15 and FOXP3, the master regulator of Treg cells. METHODS: The CD3+T cell and Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T cells were overexpressioned or knockdown MKL-1 and STAT5a and tested for Treg cell development and function. Direct interaction of MKL-1 and STAT5a were analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation assays, Luciferase assay, Immunofluoresence Staining and Yeast two-hybrid screening. The effect of MKL-1 and STAT5a on the Treg genes expression was analyzed by qPCR and western blotting and Flow cytometry. RESULTS: However, the molecular mechanisms mediating STAT5b-dependent Treg genes expression and Treg cell phenotype and function in autoimmune diseases are not well defined. Here, we report that the MKL-1 is a coactivator for the major Treg genes transcription factor STAT5b, which is required for human Treg cell phenotype and function. The N terminus of STAT5b, which contains a basic coiled-coil protein-protein interaction domain, binds the C-terminal activation domain of MKL-1 and enhances MKL-1 mediated transcriptional activation of Treg-specific, CArG containing promoters, including the Treg-specific genes Foxp3. Suppression of endogenous STAT5b expression by specific small interfering RNA attenuates MKL-1 transcriptional activation in cultured human cells. The STAT5b-MKL-1 interaction identifies a role of Treg-specific gene regulation and regulated mouse Treg cell development and function and suggests a possible mechanism for the protective effects of autoimmune disease Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate for the first time that MKL-1 is a coactivator for STAT5b, the regulator of Treg cell development and function. Video abstract.
32647892 | Interleukin-7 and interleukin-15 drive CD4+CD28null T lymphocyte expansion and function in patients with acute coronary syndrome. AIMS: Inflammation has important roles in atherosclerosis. CD4+CD28null (CD28null) T cells are a specialized T lymphocyte subset that produce inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. CD28null T cells expand preferentially in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) rather than stable angina and are barely detectable in healthy subjects. Importantly, ACS patients with CD28null T-cell expansion have increased risk for recurrent acute coronary events and poor prognosis, compared to ACS patients in whom this cell subset does not expand. The mechanisms regulating CD28null T-cell expansion in ACS remain elusive. We therefore investigated the role of cytokines in CD28null T-cell expansion in ACS. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-purity sorted CD4+ T cells from ACS patients were treated with a panel of cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-15), and effects on the number, phenotype, and function of CD28null T cells were analysed and compared to the control counterpart CD28+ T-cell subset. IL-7- and IL-15-induced expansion of CD28null T cells from ACS patients, while inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 did not. The mechanisms underlying CD28null T-cell expansion by IL-7/IL-15 were preferential activation and proliferation of CD28null T cells compared to control CD28+ T cells. Additionally, IL-7/IL-15 markedly augmented CD28null T-cell cytotoxic function and interferon-gamma production. Further mechanistic analyses revealed differences in baseline expression of component chains of IL-7/IL-15 receptors (CD127 and CD122) and increased baseline STAT5 phosphorylation in CD28null T cells from ACS patients compared to the control CD28+ T-cell subset. Notably, we demonstrate that CD28null T-cell expansion was significantly inhibited by Tofacitinib, a selective JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor that blocks IL-7/IL-15 signalling. CONCLUSION: Our novel data show that IL-7 and IL-15 drive the expansion and function of CD28null T cells from ACS patients suggesting that IL-7/IL-15 blockade may prevent expansion of these cells and improve patient outcomes.
32958854 | The anti-apoptotic Coxiella burnetii effector protein AnkG is a strain specific virulence factor. The ability to inhibit host cell apoptosis is important for the intracellular replication of the obligate intracellular pathogen Coxiella burnetii, as it allows the completion of the lengthy bacterial replication cycle. Effector proteins injected into the host cell by the C. burnetii type IVB secretion system (T4BSS) are required for the inhibition of host cell apoptosis. AnkG is one of these anti-apoptotic effector proteins. The inhibitory effect of AnkG requires its nuclear localization, which depends on p32-dependent intracellular trafficking and importin-alpha1-mediated nuclear entry of AnkG. Here, we compared the sequences of ankG from 37 C. burnetii isolates and classified them in three groups based on the predicted protein size. The comparison of the three different groups allowed us to identify the first 28 amino acids as essential and sufficient for the anti-apoptotic activity of AnkG. Importantly, only the full-length protein from the first group is a bona fide effector protein injected into host cells during infection and has anti-apoptotic activity. Finally, using the Galleria mellonella infection model, we observed that AnkG from the first group has the ability to attenuate pathology during in vivo infection, as it allows survival of the larvae despite bacterial replication.
33526873 | Clinical, immunophenotypic and genomic findings of NK lymphoblastic leukemia: a study from the Bone Marrow Pathology Group. Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes of the native immune system that play a pivotal role in host defense and immune surveillance. While the conceptual view of NK-neoplasms is evolving, little is known about the rare NK lymphoblastic leukemia (NK-LL), which remains as a provisional entity in the 2016 WHO Classification. The goal of this study is to characterize NK-LL cases and compare with other CD56 co-expressing acute leukemias. We identified 105 cases, diagnosed as NK-LL (6), CD56+ acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) (6), CD56+ T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-LL) (51), and CD56+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (42). Compared to AUL patients, NK-LL patients were significantly younger (p = 0.021) and presented with higher white blood cell (WBC) (p = 0.037) and platelet counts (p = 0.041). Flow cytometry showed more frequent expression of cytoplasmic CD3 (cCD3, p = 0.064) and CD33, (p = 0.065), while HLA-DR was significantly absent from NK-LL (p = 0.035) compared to AUL. Compared to T-ALL, NK-LL cases showed less frequent cCD3 (p = 0.002), CD4 (p = 0.051), and CD10 expression (p = 0.06). The frequency of abnormal karyotypes was similar between NK-LL, AUL, and T-ALL. The mutational profile differed in four leukemia groups, with a significance enrichment of NOTCH1 (p = 0.002), ETV6 (p = 0.002) and JAK3 (p = 0.02) mutations in NK-LL as compared to AML. As compared to T-ALL, NK-LL cases showed a higher number of total mutations (p = 0.04) and significantly more frequent ETV6 mutations (p = 0.004). Clinical outcome data showed differences in overall survival between all four groups (p = 0.0175), but no difference in event free survival (p = 0.246). In this largest study to date, we find that that NK-LL shows clinical presentation, immunophenotypic and molecular characteristics distinct from AUL, T-ALL, and AML. Our findings suggest NK-LL is a distinct acute leukemia entity and should be considered in the clinical diagnosis of acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.
33584707 | Supraphysiological Levels of IL-2 in Jak3-Deficient Mice Promote Strong Proliferative Responses of Adoptively Transferred Naive CD8+ T Cells. The antigen-independent, strong proliferative responses of naive CD8+ T cells have been well demonstrated in a particular strain of mice lacking IL-2 receptors. This type of proliferation is mainly driven by common gamma-chain (gammac) cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, present at abnormally high levels in these mice. Similarly, in the present study, we showed that mice lacking Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), a tyrosine kinase crucial for gammac cytokine signaling, could induce strong proliferation of adoptively transferred naive CD8+ T cells. This proliferation was also independent of antigenic stimulation, but heavily dependent on IL-2, as evidenced by the failure of proliferation of adoptively transferred IL-2 receptor alpha- and beta-chain-deficient naive CD8+ T cells. Consistent with this, Jak3-/- mice showed elevated serum levels of IL-2 compared to wild-type mice, and interestingly, IL-2 production was due to high levels of accumulation of activated CD4+ T cells in Jak3-/- mice along with defective CD4+ T regulatory cells. Collectively, these findings reveal previously unidentified unique immune contexts of Jak3-/- mice that cause robust IL-2-driven T cell expansion and have a clinical implication for designing a treatment strategy for human patients with loss-of-function genetic mutations of Jak3.
37280393 | Elevated nuclear PIGL disrupts the cMyc/BRD4 axis and improves PD-1 blockade therapy by dampening tumor immune evasion. To improve the efficacy of lenvatinib in combination with programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we screened the suppressive metabolic enzymes that sensitize HCC to lenvatinib and PD-1 blockade, thus impeding HCC progression. After analysis of the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class L (PIGL) ranked first in the positive selection list. PIGL depletion had no effect on tumor cell growth in vitro but reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo to support tumor cell survival. Specifically, nuclear PIGL disrupted the interaction between cMyc/BRD4 on the distant promoter of target genes and thus decreased the expression of CCL2 and CCL20, which are involved in shaping the immunosuppressive TME by recruiting macrophages and regulatory T cells. PIGL phosphorylation at Y81 by FGFR2 abolished the interaction of PIGL with importin alpha/beta1, thus retaining PIGL in the cytosol and facilitating tumor evasion by releasing CCL2 and CCL20. Clinically, elevated nuclear PIGL predicts a better prognosis for HCC patients and presents a positive correlation with CD8 + T-cell enrichment in tumors. Clinically, our findings highlight that the nuclear PIGL intensity or the change in PIGL-Y81 phosphorylation should be used as a biomarker to guide lenvatinib with PD-1 blockade therapy.
37660905 | APOLLO, a testis-specific Drosophila ortholog of importin-4, mediates the loading of protamine-like protein Mst77F into sperm chromatin. Nuclear DNA in metazoan sperm is packed with a family of small, positively charged proteins termed SNBPs (sperm nuclear basic proteins), including mammalian and Drosophila protamines. During spermiogenesis, somatic cell chromatin is taken apart and replaced with sperm chromatin in a multi-step process leading to an extraordinary condensation of the genome. During fertilization, the ova face a similarly challenging task of SNBP eviction and reassembly of nucleosome-based chromatin. Despite its importance for the animal life cycle, sperm chromatin metabolism, including the biochemical machinery mediating the mutual replacement of histones and SNBPs, remains poorly studied. In Drosophila, Mst77F is one of the first SNBPs loaded into the spermatocyte nuclei. It persists in mature spermatozoa and is essential for sperm compaction and male fertility. Here, by using in vitro biochemical assays, we identify chaperones that can mediate the eviction and loading of Mst77F on DNA, thus facilitating the interconversions of chromatin forms in the male gamete. Unlike NAP1 and TAP/p32 chaperones that disassemble Mst77F-DNA complexes, ARTEMIS and APOLLO, orthologs of mammalian importin-4, mediate the deposition of Mst77F on DNA or oligonucleosome templates, accompanied by the dissociation of histone-DNA complexes. In vivo, a mutation of testis-specific Apollo brings about a defect of Mst77F loading, abnormal sperm morphology and male infertility. We identify importin-4 ortholog APL as a critical component of sperm chromatin assembly apparatus in Drosophila. Unexpectedly, we discover that in addition to recognized roles in protein traffic, a nuclear transport receptor (importin-4) can function directly in chromatin remodeling as a dual, histone- and SNBP-specific chaperone.
37678027 | Crosstalk between PD-L1 and Jak2-Stat3/ MAPK-AP1 signaling promotes oral cancer progression, invasion and therapy resistance. BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1)is an antitumor immunity molecule and a great target to cure oral cancer; nonetheless, the limited success can be attributed to many complex pathways and tumor-related interferences. METHODS: In the present study, 150 human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissue samples, including 17 adjacent normals, 56 primary tumors, 47 invasive tumors, and 30 therapy-resistant (RT) samples, were included. The parental/cisplatin-resistant (CisR-SCC4/9) cells were utilized for overexpression (Jak1-3 wild type and catalytically inactive), knockdown (PD-L1 siRNA), targeting MAPK/PI3K/Jak-Stat pathways (SMIs) and checking microsomes. The expression of PD-L1, transcription factors (TFs), signaling pathways, survival/apoptosis, therapy resistance, and invasiveness-related molecules/their activity were determined by RT-PCR, Immunohistochemistry, Western blot, Gelatin Zymography, and MTT assay. RESULTS: Advanced OSCC tumors (invasive and drug-resistance), CisR-SCC4/9 cells, and secretory exosomes (CisR-SCC4/9) were found with increased PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 mRNA/protein showed a positive correlation with different TFs (AP1 > Stat3 > c-myc > NFkappaB) in tumor samples. The PD-L1 expression was more influenced by Jak-Stat/ MAPK-AP1 pathways over PI3K. The ectopic expression of Jak1-3 suggests Jak2 inducted PD-L1 level over Jak1/Jak3. Finally, PD-L1 directly supports survival (Bcl-xL, Bax, cleaved caspase-3), invasion (MMP2/9), and drug-resistance (ALDH-1A1/-3A1) program in OSCC through its link with several molecules. CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 was regulated mainly by the Jak2-Stat3/ MAPK-AP1 pathway, and besides the routine immunological functions, it supports OSCC survival, invasion, and therapy resistance. PD-L1 can be used as an indicator of severity and can be targeted along with Jak2-Stat3/ MAPK-AP1 for a better outcome OSCC.
37712558 | The JAK3Q988P mutation reveals oncogenic potential and resistance to ruxolitinib. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) arises from the malignant transformation of T-cell progenitors at various differentiation stages. Given that patients who relapse have a dismal prognosis, there is an urgent need to identify the molecular alterations that are present in such patients and promote leukemogenesis to implement personalized therapies with higher efficacy and fewer adverse effects. In the present manuscript, we identified the JAK3Q988P mutation in a T-ALL patient who did not achieve a durable response after the conventional treatment and whose tumor cells at relapse presented constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Although JAK3Q988P has been previously identified in T-ALL patients from different studies, the functional consequences exerted by this mutation remain unexplored. Through the combination of different hematopoietic cellular models, we functionally characterize JAK3Q988P as an oncogenic mutation that contributes to leukemogenesis. Notably, JAK3Q988P not only promotes constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in the absence of cytokines and growth factors, as is the case for other JAK3 mutations that have been functionally characterized as oncogenic, but also functions independently of JAK1 and IL2RG, resulting in high oncogenic potential as well as resistance to ruxolitinib. Our results indicate that ruxolitinib may not be efficient for future patients bearing the JAK3Q988P mutation who instead may obtain greater benefits from treatments involving other pharmacological inhibitors such as tofacitinib.
37735396 | Investigation of the anti-inflammatory effects of native potential probiotics as supplementary therapeutic agents in an in-vitro model of inflammation. BACKGROUND: IBD is considered an inflammatory disease with abnormal and exaggerated immune responses. To control the symptoms, different theraputic agents could be used, however, utilizing the agents with the least side effects could be important. Probiotics as beneficial microorganisms are one of the complementory theraputic agents that could be used to modulate inflammatory signaling pathways. In the current study, we aimed to identify the precise molecular effects of potential probiotics on signaling pathways involved in the development of inflammation. METHODS: A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was used to analyze the expression of JAK /STAT (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2, STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 and STAT6) and inflammatory genes (NEMO, TIRAP, IRAK, and RIP) after the HT -29 cell line treatment with the sonicated pathogens and potential probiotics. A cytokine assay was also used to evaluate IL -6 and IL -1beta production after potential probiotic treatment. RESULTS: The potential probiotic cocktail downregulated the JAK genes and TIRAP, IRAK4, NEMO, and RIP genes in the NF-kB pathway compared with cells that were treated with sonicated gram negative pathogens. The expression of STAT genes was different after potential probiotic treatment. The production of IL -6 and IL -1beta decreased after potential probiotic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the importance of controlling the symptoms of IBD to improve the life quality of the patients, using probiotic could be crucial. In the current study the studied native potential probiotic cocktails showed anti-inflammatory effects via modulation of JAK /STAT and NF-kB signaling pathways. This observation suggests that our native potential probiotics consumption could be useful in reducing intestinal inflammation.
37812490 | JAK/STAT inhibition modifies the ILC1 immune response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVES: Recent evidence suggests that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) might be involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and individuals at risk of RA exhibited an increased frequency of ILC1. JAK3 participates in ILC1 and ILC3 differentiation. Tofacitinib and the Janus Kinase (JAK) 3 inhibitor, PF-06651600, impair the ability of human intraepithelial ILC1 (iILC1) to produce IFN-gamma and the proliferation of ILC1 and ILC3. Our study aims to evaluate the ex vivo effects of tofacitinib in RA patients and to investigate if ILC1s and ILC3s are specific targets of tofacitinib in RA. METHODS: Twenty RA patients starting tofacitinib and 10 RA patients starting anti-TNFalpha were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients, collected before and three months after therapy, were cultured to evaluate ILC1 and ILC3 frequencies and the respective production of IFN-gamma and IL-17 by flow cytometry analysis. PBMCs of RA patients were in vitro cultured with tofacitinib to evaluate the dose effects on ILC frequencies. RESULTS: RA patients showed a significant expansion of ILC1 but not ILC3. Unlike anti-TNFalpha treated patients, in whom no reduction in ILCs was reported, after three months of tofacitinib therapy the overall ILC frequency was reduced, as well as the ILC1 ability to release IFN-gamma. In vitro treatment of PBMCs with tofacitinib demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in the frequency of ILCs compared to untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrate that tofacitinib modulates the innate immune response by reducing the frequency of ILC1 cells and their production of IFN-gamma.
37883818 | Identification of HHT-9041P1: A novel potent and selective JAK1 inhibitor in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease associated with long-term disability and premature mortality. If left untreated, it can seriously affect patients' quality of life. The JAK-STAT signal transduction process is known to affect the occurrence and development of RA, and small molecule JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib, have been identified as treatments for RA. However, tofacitinib is a non-selective JAK inhibitor that was found to be associated with dose-limiting tolerability and safety issues, such as anemia in phase 2 dose-ranging studies. Therefore, we developed a selective JAK1 inhibitor, HHT-9041P1, to overcome target-related adverse reactions. We used enzyme and cytokine potency assays in vitro as well as the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in vivo to explore the efficacy and mechanism. In vitro, HHT-9041P1 was diluted (0.017 nM-1 mM) in DMSO) and mixed with JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 or TYK2 kinases for use in the respective assays for inhibitory activity and selectivity evaluation. Fresh human PBMCs were activated and incubated with 100 ng/mL cytokine IL-6 or 20 ng/mL GM-CSF for use in the investigation of the immune mechanism. In vivo, HHT-9041P1 (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage twice daily to CIA model Lewis rats from Day 8 to Day 29 for paw swelling and arthritis score evaluation. At the end of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed before collection of the hind ankle joint, spleen and blood for analysis of inflammation, arthritis phenotypes, inflammatory cytokine expression and Th1 cell proportions. As expected, HHT-9041P1 showed 10-fold greater selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2, and 23-fold greater selectivity over JAK3 in cellular assays. The high selectivity of HHT-9041P1 was also validated by in vivo safety studies. HHT-9041P1 demonstrated significant efficacy in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and was associated with reduced helper T Cell 1 (Th1) cell differentiation. HHT-9041P1 also exhibited excellent pharmacokinetics properties. Thus, HHT-9041P1 was identified as a candidate for clinical development with many options for the treatment of RA.
37947625 | JAK3 Inhibition Regulates Stemness and Thereby Controls Glioblastoma Pathogenesis. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most deadly brain tumor, effective treatment options for which still remain elusive. The current treatment procedure of maximal resection followed by chemotherapy has proved to be grossly insufficient to prevent disease progression and death. Despite best efforts, the maximum survival post-diagnosis is a mere 1.5 years. Therefore, there is a huge unmet clinical need to find effective therapeutic procedures to prevent the pathogenesis and relapse of GBM. Small-molecule inhibitors of signaling pathways are an attractive option to prevent various types of tumors. However, no effective small-molecule inhibitors have been successful against GBM in clinical trials. Various signaling pathways are altered and an array of signaling molecules, transcription factors (TFs), and epigenetic modifying factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of GBM. JAK-STAT pathway alteration is an important contributor to GBM pathogenesis and relapse. Many small-molecule inhibitors of JAKs, or STAT TFs, especially JAK2 and STAT3, have been assessed for their anti-tumor activity in GBM. However, no definitive success so far has been achieved. Herein, by using two small-molecule inhibitors of JAK3, we show that they are quite effective in inhibiting GBM cell proliferation and neurosphere formation, downregulating their stemness character, and inducing differentiation into neuronal origin cells. The effect of a single treatment with the drugs, both in a serum-containing differentiation medium and in a proliferation medium containing EGF and FGF, was really strong in limiting GBM cell growth, suggesting a potential therapeutic application for these JAK inhibitors in GBM therapy.
38007359 | JAK inhibitors: Is specificity at all relevant? BACKGROUND: Cytokines are soluble factors that affect host defense and maintain immune homeostasis. Altered cytokine production leads to a dysfunctional immune responses and immune-related diseases. Cytokines bind to specific receptors and trigger various intracellular signaling cascades and targeting cytokines and/or their receptors has been effective in treating inflammatory diseases. OBJECTIVES: Type I and II cytokine receptors activate four Janus kinases (JAKs), namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 and targeting of these enzymes resulted in the development of successful drugs now referred as JAK inhibitors or JAKinibs. RESULTS: JAKinibs can be divided in three \generations.\ First-generation JAKinibs, molecules acting in an orthosteric manner, inhibit multiple JAKs and interfere with the biologic activity of many factors. With the idea of reducing side effects, second-generation JAKinibs, still orthosteric ATP competitors, have been developed with increased selectivity towards one or two JAKs. Third-generation JAKinibs have exploited our increased understanding of the structure and function of JAK domains and are allosteric inhibitors as they bind to specific residues in the pseudokinase domain. These third generation JAKInb indeed seems to possess a better safety profile. Notably, inhibition of cytokine activity in specific tissues could be more important than selective enzymatic blockade and for this reason, topical, inhaled, or as a non-absorbable JAKinibs are also being developed. CONCLUSIONS: While JAKinibs entered the clinical arena about ten years ago, our understanding of these drugs and their selectivity relative to their activity and safety is still incomplete. More research is therefore needed to achieve better usage of these class of drugs.
38007449 | Tofacitinib in the treatment of primary Sjogren's syndrome-associated interstitial lung disease: study protocol for a prospective, randomized, controlled and open-label trial. INTRODUCTION: Tofacitinib, a selective inhibitor of JAK1 and/or JAK3, is considered to alleviate the pulmonary condition of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) through its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label trial. The trial will compare a 52-week course of oral tofacitinib with traditional therapy cyclophosphamide (CYC) combined with azathioprine (AZA) in the treatment of pSS-ILD. A total of 120 patients will be randomly assigned into two treatment groups with a 1:1 ratio and followed for 52 weeks from the first dose. The primary endpoint of the study is the increase of forced vital capacity (FVC) at 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints include high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide of the lung (DLCO), the Mahler dyspnea index, the health-related quality of life (HARQoL) score, the cough symptom score, EULAR Sjogren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI), and safety. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first randomized controlled trial to investigate tofacitinib compared to the traditional regimen of CYC in combination with AZA in the treatment of pSS-ILD, which will provide data on efficacy and safety and further elucidate the role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in the development of pSS-ILD.

38028419 | Influence of adalimumab on interleukin 12/23 signalling pathways in human keratinocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide A. Introduction: The interleukin-12/23 (IL-12/23) signalling pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. In addition, even molecularly targeted therapy has been reported to lose adequate response to treatment. Aim: To determine the expression patterns of mRNAs and miRNAs related to IL-12/23 signalling pathways in the human keratinocyte culture exposed to liposaccharide A (LPS) and then adalimumab in comparison with untreated cells. Material and methods: Human, adult, low-Calcium, high-Temperature keratinocyte (HaCaT) cultures were exposed to 1 microg/ml LPS for 8 h, and then adalimumab was added to the cultures at a concentration of 8 microg/ml and incubated for 2, 8, and 24 h. We used mRNA and miRNA microarray, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. Results: STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, IL-6, IL-6R, SOCS3, and JAK3 genes differentiated HaCaT cultures with the drug from controls regardless of the time the cells were exposed to the drug. The addition of adalimumab to a culture previously exposed to LPS resulted in silencing of SOCS3 and IL-6 expression compared to the control, while for the other transcripts they were found to be overexpressed compared to the control culture. The assessment indicated the strongest connections between JAK3 and hsa-miR-373-5p (target score 96); SOCS3, STAT5, and hsa-miR-1827 (target score 96). Conclusions: Our study indicates that adalimumab has the strongest modulating effect on mRNA and miRNA expression of JAK/STAT and IL-6-dependent IL-12/23 pathways.
38053908 | In vitro and in vivo modelling of mutant JAK3/STAT5 signaling in leukemia. Mutations within the IL7-R-JAK-STAT signaling pathway are important drivers of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here we describe the important steps required to generate retroviral particles for the stable expression of mutant JAK3 constructs that induce constitutive JAK/STAT signaling. These are subsequently used for the viral transduction of the IL-3 cytokine-dependent Ba/F3 cell line or murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for in vitro and in vivo modelling of cytokine-independent growth or leukemia initiation respectively.
38059345 | QSAR-driven screening uncovers and designs novel pyrimidine-4,6-diamine derivatives as potent JAK3 inhibitors. This study presents a robust and integrated methodology that harnesses a range of computational techniques to facilitate the design and prediction of new inhibitors targeting the JAK3/STAT pathway. This methodology encompasses several strategies, including QSAR analysis, pharmacophore modeling, ADMET prediction, covalent docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the calculation of binding free energies (MM/GBSA). An efficacious QSAR model was meticulously crafted through the employment of multiple linear regression (MLR). The initial MLR model underwent further refinement employing an artificial neural network (ANN) methodology aimed at minimizing predictive errors. Notably, both MLR and ANN exhibited commendable performance, showcasing R2 values of 0.89 and 0.95, respectively. The model's precision was assessed via leave-one-out cross-validation (CV) yielding a Q2 value of 0.65, supplemented by rigorous Y-randomization. , The pharmacophore model effectively differentiated between active and inactive drugs, identifying potential JAK3 inhibitors, and demonstrated validity with an ROC value of 0.86. The newly discovered and designed inhibitors exhibited high inhibitory potency, ranging from 6 to 8, as accurately predicted by the QSAR models. Comparative analysis with FDA-approved Tofacitinib revealed that the new compounds exhibited promising ADMET properties and strong covalent docking (CovDock) interactions. The stability of the new discovered and designed inhibitors within the JAK3 binding site was confirmed through 500 ns MD simulations, while MM/GBSA calculations supported their binding affinity. Additionally, a retrosynthetic study was conducted to facilitate the synthesis of these potential JAK3/STAT inhibitors. The overall integrated approach demonstrates the feasibility of designing novel JAK3/STAT inhibitors with robust efficacy and excellent ADMET characteristics that surpass Tofacitinib by a significant margin.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
38095643 | Conjoint research of WGCNA, single-cell transcriptome and structural biology reveals the potential targets of IDD development and treatment and JAK3 involvement. OBJECTIVES: This study conducted integrated analysis of bulk RNA sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), to comprehensively decode the most essential genes of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD); then mainly focused on the JAK3 macromolecule to identify natural compounds to provide more candidate drug options in alleviating IDD. METHODS: In the first part, we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis and WGCNA workflow to delineate the most pivotal genes of IDD. Then series of structural biology approaches and high-throughput virtual screening techniques were performed to discover potential compounds targeting JAK-STAT signaling pathway, such as Libdock, ADMET, precise molecular docking algorithm and in-vivo drug stability assessment. RESULTS: Totally 4 hub genes were determined in the development of IDD, namely VEGFA, MMP3, TNFSF11, and TIMP3, respectively. Then, 3 novel natural materials, ZINC000014952116, ZINC000003938642 and ZINC000072131515, were determined as potential compounds, with less toxicities and moderate ADME characteristics. In-vivo drug stability assessment suggested that these drugs could interact with JAK3, and their ligand-JAK3 complexes maintained the homeostasis in-vivo, which acted as regulatory role to JAK3 protein. Among them, ZINC000072131515, also known as Menaquinone, demonstrated significant protective roles to alleviate the progression of IDD in vitro, which proved the nutritional therapy in alleviating IDD. CONCLUSIONS: This study reported the essential genes in the development of IDD, and also the roles of Menaquinone to ameliorate IDD through inhibiting JAK3 protein. This study also provided more options and resources on JAK3 targeted screening, which may further expand the drug resources in the pharmaceutical market.
38106519 | Suppression of NK Cell Activation by JAK3 Inhibition: Implication in the Treatment of Autoimmune Diseases. Natural killer (NK) cell is an essential cytotoxic lymphocyte in our innate immunity. Activation of NK cells is of paramount importance in defending against pathogens, suppressing autoantibody production and regulating other immune cells. Common gamma chain (gammac) cytokines, including IL-2, IL-15, and IL-21, are defined as essential regulators for NK cell homeostasis and development. However, it is inconclusive whether gammac cytokine-driven NK cell activation plays a protective or pathogenic role in the development of autoimmunity. In this study, we investigate and correlate the differential effects of gammac cytokines in NK cell expansion and activation. IL-2 and IL-15 are mainly responsible for NK cell activation, while IL-21 preferentially stimulates NK cell proliferation. Blockade of Janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway by either JAK inhibitors or antibodies targeting gammac receptor subunits reverses the gammac cytokine-induced NK cell activation, leading to suppression of its autoimmunity-like phenotype in vitro. These results underline the mechanisms of how gammac cytokines trigger autoimmune phenotype in NK cells as a potential target to autoimmune diseases.
38136901 | Effects of Dietary Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Supplementation on the Intestinal Stem Cell Proliferation, Immunity, and Ileal Microbiota of Broiler Chickens Challenged by Coccidia and Clostridium perfringens. This study was conducted to investigate effects of dietary Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei supplementation on the intestinal stem cell proliferation, immunity, and ileal microbiota of broiler chickens challenged by coccidia and Clostridium perfringens. A total of 336 one-day-old Ross 308 chickens were randomly assigned into four groups. Chickens in the control (CTR) group were fed basal diet, and chickens in the three challenged groups were fed basal diets supplemented with nothing (CCP group), 1.0 x 109 CFU/kg L. fermentum (LF_CCP group), and 1.0 x 109 CFU/kg L. paracasei (LP_CCP group), respectively. All challenged birds were infected with coccildia on day 9 and Clostridium perfringens during days 13-18. The serum and intestinal samples were collected on days 13 and 19. The results showed that L. fermentum significantly increased jejunal gene expression of cdxB (one of the intestinal stem cell marker genes) on day 13. Additionally, L. fermentum significantly up-regulated mRNA levels of JAK3 and TYK2 and tended to increase STAT6 mRNA expression in jejunum on day 19. In the cecal tonsil, both L. fermentum and L. paracasei decreased mRNA expression of JAK2 on day 13, and L. fermentum down-regulated JAK1-2, STAT1, and STAT5-6 gene expressions on day 19. Ileal microbiological analysis showed that coccidial infection increased the Escherichia-Shigella, Lactobacillus, and Romboutsia abundance and decreased Candidatus_Arthromitus richness on day 13, which were reversed by Lactobacillus intervention. Moreover, Lactobacilli increased ileal Lactobacillus richness on day 19. In conclusion, Lactobacilli alleviated the impairment of intestinal stem cell proliferation and immunity in coccidia- and C. perfringens-challenged birds via modulating JAK/STAT signaling and reshaping intestinal microflora.
38172590 | Whole transcriptome sequencing for revealing the pathogenesis of sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix globosa. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of sporotrichosis and identify possible novel therapeutic targets. Total RNA was extracted from skin lesion samples from sporotrichosis patients and used to construct a long-chain RNA transcriptome library and miRNA transcriptome library for whole transcriptome sequencing. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the groups were identified, and then Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis enrichment analyses were performed based on the DEGs. An lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed. The expressions of JAK/STAT pathway-related proteins were detected in the patient and control tissues using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in various infectious diseases and immune response-related signaling pathways. Competing endogenous RNA network analysis was performed and identified the hub lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs. Compared with the control group, the mRNA expressions of SOCS3, IL-6, and JAK3 were significantly upregulated, while the expression of STAT3 did not change significantly. Also, the protein expressions of SOCS3, IL-6, JAK3, and STAT3, as well as phosphorylated JAK3 and STAT3, were significantly upregulated. We identified 671 lncRNA DEGs, 3281 mRNA DEGs, and 214 miRNA DEGs to be involved in Sporothrix globosa infection. The study findings suggest that the JAK/STAT pathway may be a therapeutic target for sporotrichosis.
38200905 | The Genetic Selection of HSPD1 and HSPE1 Reduce Inflammation of Liver and Spleen While Restraining the Growth and Development of Skeletal Muscle in Wuzhishan Pigs. Wuzhishan (WZS) pigs, which are minipigs native to Hainan Province in China, are characterized by strong resistance to extreme hot temperatures and humidity. The relationship between their immune response and growth still needs to be clarified. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect variations within 37 WZS pigs, 32 Large White (LW) pigs, and 22 Xiangxi black (XXB) pigs, and ~2.49 GB of SNPs were obtained. These data were combined with those of two other pig breeds, and it was found that most of the genes detected (354) were located within the distinct genetic regions between WZS pigs and LW pigs. The network that was constructed using these genes represented a center including 12 hub genes, five of which had structural variations (SVs) within their regulatory regions. Furthermore, RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data for 12 genes were primarily consistent in liver, spleen, and LDM tissues. Notably, the expression of HSPs (HSPD1 and HSPE1) was higher while that of most genes involved in the JAK3-STAT pathway were lower in liver tissue of WZS pigs, compared with LW pigs. This likely not only reduced inflammation-related immune response but also impaired their growth. Our findings demonstrated the role of HSPs in the connection between inflammation and growth rate, while also providing the fundamental genetic selection of the adaptability of WZS pigs.
38244120 | Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a germline disease? Polycythemia Vera (PV) is typically caused by V617F or exon 12 JAK2 mutations. Little is known about Polycythemia cases where no JAK2 variants can be detected, and no other causes identified. This condition is defined as idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE). We evaluated clinical-laboratory parameters of a cohort of 56 IE patients and we determined their molecular profile at diagnosis with paired blood/buccal-DNA exome-sequencing coupled with a high-depth targeted OncoPanel to identify a possible underling germline or somatic cause. We demonstrated that most of our cohort (40/56: 71.4%) showed no evidence of clonal hematopoiesis, suggesting that IE is, in large part, a germline disorder. We identified 20 low mutation burden somatic variants (Variant allelic fraction, VAF, < 10%) in only 14 (25%) patients, principally involving DNMT3A and TET2. Only 2 patients presented high mutation burden somatic variants, involving DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1 and WT1. We identified recurrent germline variants in 42 (75%) patients occurring mainly in JAK/STAT, Hypoxia and Iron metabolism pathways, among them: JAK3-V722I and HIF1A-P582S; a high fraction of patients (48.2%) resulted also mutated in homeostatic iron regulatory gene HFE-H63D or C282Y. By generating cellular models, we showed that JAK3-V722I causes activation of the JAK-STAT5 axis and upregulation of EPAS1/HIF2A, while HIF1A-P582S causes suppression of hepcidin mRNA synthesis, suggesting a major role for these variants in the onset of IE.
38522714 | Cloning and expression analysis of Janus activated kinase family genes from spotted seabass (Lateolabrax maculatus). Janus kinases (JAKs) are important components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and play vital roles in innate immunity, autoimmune diseases, and inflammation. However, information about JAKs remains largely unknown in the spotted seabass, a fish species of Perciformes with great commercial value in the aquaculture industry. The aims of this study are to obtain the complete cDNA sequences of JAKs (JAK1, JAK2A, JAK2B, JAK3 and TYK2) from spotted seabass and to investigate their roles upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Edwardsiella tarda, using RT-PCR, PCR and qRT-PCR methods. All five JAK genes from the spotted seabass, each encode more than 1100 amino acids residues. JAK1 and JAK3 consist of 24 exons and 23 introns, whereas JAK2A, JAK2B and TYK2 consist of 23 exons and 22 introns. Furthermore, these five spotted seabass JAKs share high sequence identities with those of other fish species in protein domain analysis, synteny analysis, and phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, these five JAK genes were ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined from healthy fish, and inducible expressions of JAKs were observed in the intestine, gill, head kidney, and spleen following LPS treatment or E. tarda infection. These findings indicate that all these JAK genes are involved in the antibacterial immunity of the spotted seabass and provide a basis for further understanding the mechanism of JAKs antibacterial response in the spotted sea bass.
7518451 | Identification of interleukin-2 receptor-associated tyrosine kinase p116 as novel leukocyte-specific Janus kinase. Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) has recently been linked to signal transduction by cytokine receptors of the hematopoietin family. We have recently described a 116-kDa tyrosine kinase (p116) present in interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor complexes in human YT cells that showed functional characteristics of a JAK kinase. These included receptor association, rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation kinetics in response to ligand, and in vitro autophosphorylating tyrosine kinase activity (Kirken, R. A., Rui, H., Evans, G. A., and Farrar, W. L. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 22765-22770). Here we extend these observations by demonstrating structural homologies between IL-2-modulated p116 and prolactin-modulated JAK2 in the rat T cell line Nb2. These include similar net charge as determined by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrofocusing and related primary structure based upon phosphopeptide mapping of V8 protease-digested hyperphosphorylated proteins. This putative JAK kinase underwent marked tyrosine phosphorylation in response to IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7, lymphoid growth factors that use the common IL-2 receptor gamma-chain, but not in response to prolactin. Furthermore, polyclonal antisera to JAK1, JAK2, or tyrosine kinase 2 did not recognize either rat or human p116. However, we identified the IL-2-modulated p116 as the recently cloned novel leukocyte Janus kinase, L-JAK, using an antiserum to a peptide corresponding to the COOH terminus of human L-JAK.
7590968 | Bop: a new T-cell-restricted gene located upstream of and opposite to mouse CD8b. In the course of transient expression studies undertaken to determine the location of the mouse CD8b gene promoter, two additional promoter activities were detected within 600 nucleotides upstream of the gene. One activity directs transcription in the same direction as CD8b but fails to transcribe the CAT reporter gene due to an apparent transcription-blocking element lying between it and the gene. The second activity directs transcription opposite to that of the CD8b gene. Northern hybridization with a probe consisting of nucleotides -875 to -550 relative to the site of CD8b transcription initiation revealed hybridizing species of 4 kilobases (kb) and 1.8 kb in poly-A-selected RNA from mouse thymus but not from any other tissues. Similar RNA species were detected in poly-A+ RNA from concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells and several long-term CTL lines but not from the EL4 or BW5147 T-cell lines or the J558L myeloma. The mRNA species were most abundant in cells of a secondary mixed leukocyte culture which were greater than 95% CD8(+). Northern hybridizations using single-stranded unidirectional probes indicated that these mRNAs represent transcription opposite to the CD8b gene. The tissue and cell type distribution of this newly-discovered gene (designated Bop for CD8b opposite) are consistent with T-cell-specific and possibly CD8-positive T-cell-specific expression. The head-to-head arrangement of the Bop and CD8b genes is reminiscent of the arrangement of the Tap1 and Lmp2 genes, and the expression of the Bop gene in CD8-positive cells raises the possibility that these genes are involved in the same functional pathway.
7729418 | An amino acid substitution in the Drosophila hopTum-l Jak kinase causes leukemia-like hematopoietic defects. Proteins of the Jak family of non-receptor kinases play important roles in mammalian hematopoietic signal transduction. They mediate the cellular response to a wide range of cytokines and growth factors. A dominant mutation in a Drosophila Jak kinase, hopscotchTumorous-lethal (hopTum-l), causes hematopoietic defects. Here we conduct a molecular analysis of hopTum-l. We demonstrate that the hopTum-l hematopoietic phenotype is caused by a single amino acid substitution of glycine to glutamic acid at residue 341. We generate a true revertant of the hopTum-l mutation, in which both the molecular lesion and the mutant hematopoietic phenotype revert back to wild type. We also examine the effects of the G341E substitution in transgenic flies. The results indicate that a mutant Jak kinase can cause leukemia-like abnormalities.
8022790 | Molecular cloning of L-JAK, a Janus family protein-tyrosine kinase expressed in natural killer cells and activated leukocytes. Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are critical enzymes for receptor-mediated signaling in lymphocytes. Because natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes with specialized effector function, we set out to identify PTKs preferentially expressed in these cells. One such PTK was identified and molecularly cloned. The predicted amino acid sequence shows that this kinase lacks SH2 or SH3 domains typical of src family kinases but has tandem nonidentical catalytic domains, indicating that it is a member of the Janus family of PTKs. Immunoprecipitation using antiserum generated against a peptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequence of this gene revealed a kinase with a molecular weight of approximately 125,000. The pattern of expression of this kinase contrasted sharply with that of other Janus kinases, which are ubiquitously expressed. The kinase described in the present study was found to be more limited in its expression; expression was found in NK cells and an NK-like cell line but not in resting T cells or in other tissues. In contrast, stimulated and transformed T cells expressed the gene, suggesting a role in lymphoid activation. Because of its homology and tissue expression, we have tentatively termed this PTK gene L-JAK for leukocyte Janus kinase.
8588336 | Occurrence of T lymphocytes in perivascular regions of the lung after intratracheal infection of swine with Pasteurella multocida. The defence mechanisms of the lung acting against airborne antigens (bacteria) are not yet fully understood. Therefore, we investigated cell-derived immunological processes in porcine pulmonary tissue. The incidence and distribution of leukocyte subpopulations in lungs, lung lymph nodes and tonsils from eight animals intratracheally infected with Pasteurella multocida (P.m.) type A wild strain and from four non-infected control animals were established by immunohistochemistry, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against specific porcine leukocyte antigens: MHC Class II (MHC II), SWC1, SWC3a, CD2a, CD4a, CD8b. In the test animals, a broad layer of SWC1+ cells and SWC3a+ cells emerged in the subsinusoidal region of lung lymph nodes and in the bronchoalveolar spaces of the lung as early as 4 and 24 h after infection, and in the subsinusoidal regions of the lung lymph nodes only very few cells could be stained with the mAb against the MHC II antigen. We could not detect any MHC Class II+ cells in the bronchoalveolar spaces at this time of the investigation. In the course of the disappearance of the SWC1+ cells and SWC3+ cells, CD2a+, CD4a+ and, in lower numbers, CD8b+ T lymphocytes seemed to concentrate in the perivascular and, partially, the peribronchial regions of the lung 72 h after infection. By means of the double immunostaining method, we could demonstrate an accumulation of CD4a+ cells and CD8b+ cells after infection which lacked the SWC1 antigen, indicating that these cells were activated T lymphocytes. The same cell types (SWC1-/CD4a+ and SWC1-/CD8b+ cells) as well as CD8b-/CD4a+ cells could be observed in the interstitium of the lung 72 h after infection.
8781121 | Characterization of the mouse CD8 beta chain-encoding gene promoter region. We identified a regulatory region of the mouse CD8 beta chain-encoding gene (CD8b) promoter. The CD8b 5' upstream sequence could not drive the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene without T-cell receptor or SV40 enhancer elements. The results of transient transfection assays indicated that the dominant transcription-activating element within the CD8b-promoter is located at -45 to -40 base pairs (CCGCCC) from the transcriptional initiation site. Elimination of this element, by deletion or specific point mutation, significantly reduced transcriptional activity from this promoter. The sequence of this core region corresponds to a GC box motif known to act as a binding site for a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional activator, Sp1. However, the promoter activity appeared to be T-cell-specific, and the gel retardation assay using the core sequence as a probe revealed formation of complexes with multiple nuclear factors, one of them being specific to T lineage cells. These data suggest that the CD8b promoter requires a cis-acting element as well as several nuclear factors for full-range, tissue-specific transcription.
9013956 | The Bop gene adjacent to the mouse CD8b gene encodes distinct zinc-finger proteins expressed in CTLs and in muscle. The Bop gene (for CD8b opposite) is located immediately upstream of the mouse CD8b gene. Expression of Bop gene transcripts was previously observed in several long term CTL lines and in thymus. The present studies demonstrate that expression of the Bop gene in lymphocytes appears to be confined to CD8-positive cells, and that Bop gene expression is inducible by Con A. They further show that a single Bop gene encodes protein products with distinct amino-terminal sequences that are expressed in CTLs (t-BOP) and in cardiac and skeletal muscle (skm-BOP), as well as what appears to be a noncoding cDNA (t-ncb) expressed only in CTLs. The t-BOP and t-ncb cDNAs in CTLs result from alternative splicing of a single primary transcript, whereas the Bop transcripts expressed in CTLs and in muscle appear to be transcribed from different promoters. The BOP proteins expressed in CTLs and muscle contain zinc finger-like motifs with homology to those of the ETO/MTG8 proto-oncogene and several other proteins of interest. Western blot analysis with a hamster anti-BOP mAb have detected the BOP protein in muscle cells and in COS 7 cells transfected with Bop cDNA constructs.
9547341 | Impaired interleukin 4 signaling in T helper type 1 cells. Cluster of differentation (CD)4+ T helper cells (Th)1s fail to produce interleukin (IL)-4. Even if restimulated in the presence of IL-4, a condition that induces IL-4-producing capacity in naive CD4+ T cells, Th1s fail to become IL-4 producers. We report that Th1 cells have a major impairment in IL-4 signaling. When compared to both Th2s and naive T cells, they display a striking diminution in phosphorylation of Stat6. They also show reduced phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK)-3 and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-2 when compared to Th2s. Stat6 and JAK-3 are present in equivalent amounts in Th1s and Th2s, but IRS-2 protein levels are much lower in Th1s than in Th2s. Altered sensitivity to IL-4, the major inducer of the Th2 phenotype, may explain the stability of the Th1 state.
10811846 | Macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha transgene attracts dendritic cells to established murine tumors and suppresses tumor growth. Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful antigen-presenting cells that function as the principal activators of T cells. Since the human CC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha (MIP-3alpha), is chemotactic for DCs in vitro, we hypothesized that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of MIP-3alpha (AdMIP-3alpha) to tumors might induce local accumulation of DCs and inhibit growth of preexisting tumors. AdMIP-3alpha directed expression of mRNA and protein in vitro, and the supernatant of A549 cells infected with AdMIP-3alpha was chemotactic for DCs. In vivo, injection of AdMIP-3alpha into subcutaneous tumors resulted in local expression of the MIP-3alpha cDNA and in the local accumulation of DCs. In four syngeneic tumor models, growth of established tumors was significantly inhibited compared with untreated tumors or tumors injected with control vector, and in all but the poorly immunogenic LLC carcinoma model, this treatment increased survival advantage of the preexisting tumors. In all four tumor models, intratumoral injection of AdMIP-3alpha induced the local accumulation of CD8b. 2(+) cells and elicited tumor-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity, and adoptive transfer of splenocytes of animals receiving this treatment protected against a subsequent challenge with the identical tumor cells. In wild-type but not in CD8-deficient mice, AdMIP-3alpha inhibited the growth of tumors. Finally, AdMIP-3alpha also inhibited the growth of distant tumors. This strategy may be useful for enlisting the help of DCs to boost anti-tumor immunity against local and metastatic tumors without the necessity of ex vivo isolation and manipulation of DCs.
10839803 | T cell receptor-induced calcineurin activation regulates T helper type 2 cell development by modifying the interleukin 4 receptor signaling complex. The activation of downstream signaling pathways of both T cell receptor (TCR) and interleukin 4 receptor (IL-4R) is essential for T helper type 2 (Th2) cell development, which is central to understanding immune responses against helminthic parasites and in allergic and autoimmune diseases. However, little is known about how these two distinct signaling pathways cooperate with each other to induce Th2 cells. Here, we show that successful Th2 cell development depends on the effectiveness of TCR-induced activation of calcineurin. An inhibitor of calcineurin activation, FK506, inhibited the in vitro anti-TCR-induced Th2 cell generation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the development of Th2 cells was significantly impaired in naive T cells from dominant-negative calcineurin Aalpha transgenic mice, whereas that of Th1 cells was less affected. Efficient calcineurin activation in naive T cells upregulated Janus kinase (Jak)3 transcription and the amount of protein. The generation of Th2 cells induced in vitro by anti-TCR stimulation was inhibited significantly by the presence of Jak3 antisense oligonucleotides, suggesting that the Jak3 upregulation is an important event for the Th2 cell development. Interestingly, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5 became physically and functionally associated with the IL-4R in the anti-TCR-activated developing Th2 cells that received efficient calcineurin activation, and also in established cloned Th2 cells. In either cell population, the inhibition of STAT5 activation resulted in a diminished IL-4-induced proliferation. Moreover, our results suggest that IL-4-induced STAT5 activation is required for the expansion process of developing Th2 cells. Thus, Th2 cell development is controlled by TCR-mediated activation of the Ca(2+)/calcineurin pathway, at least in part, by modifying the functional structure of the IL-4R signaling complex.
11145642 | Cutting edge: two distinct mechanisms lead to impaired T cell homeostasis in Janus kinase 3- and CTLA-4-deficient mice. Cytokine receptor signaling and costimulatory receptor signaling play distinct roles in T cell activation. Nonetheless, deficiencies in either of these pathways lead to seemingly similar phenotypes of impaired T cell homeostasis. A dramatic expansion of CD4(+) peripheral T cells with an activated phenotype has been observed in both Janus kinase (Jak) 3-deficient and CTLA-4-deficient mice. Despite these similarities, the mechanisms driving T cell expansion may be distinct. To address this possibility, we examined the TCR repertoire of peripheral T cells in Jak3(-/-) and CTLA-4(-/-) mice using complementarity-determining region 3 spectratype analysis. Interestingly, a restricted and highly biased TCR repertoire was observed in the Jak3(-/-) T cells, strongly supporting a role for foreign Ag in the activation and expansion of these cells. In contrast, CTLA-4(-/-) T cells had a diverse and unbiased TCR repertoire, suggestive of a universal, Ag-independent mechanism of activation and expansion. These findings provide insight into the diverse mechanisms controlling T cell homeostasis.
12605694 | Human immunodeficiency virus-1 envelope glycoproteins and anti-CD4 antibodies inhibit interleukin-2-induced Jak/STAT signalling in human CD4 T lymphocytes. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection leads to a profound T cell dysfunction well before the clinical onset of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We have been accumulating evidence that one of the mechanisms responsible for this T cell deficiency may be the dysregulation of signal transduction via the interleukin (IL)-2/IL-2 receptor (R) complex. In CD4 T cells, we have observed previously that viral envelope (env) glycoproteins induce IL-2 unresponsiveness and the down-regulation of the three chains making up the IL-2R (alpha, beta, gamma) in vitro. We have now established further that this disruption of the IL-2/IL-2R system manifests itself in defective signal propagation via the Janus kinase (Jak)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in response to IL-2. The treatment of CD4 T cells with HIV env or surface ligation of CD4 with anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies inhibited the IL-2-induced activation of Jak-1 and Jak-3, as well as their targets, STAT5a and STAT5b. This Jak/STAT deficiency may contribute to the crippling of CD4 T cell responses to a cytokine central to the immune response by HIV.
15725955 | CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells, immunotherapy of cancer, and interleukin-2. CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) cells control immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and play a role in suppressing antitumor immune responses, but the mechanism of suppression in vivo remains uncertain. Recently, signaling through the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor has been shown to be critical for Treg cell differentiation and survival in vivo. Mice deficient in IL-2 or its receptor (CD25 or CD122) or deficient in downstream signaling molecules, including JAK-3 and STAT-5, do not develop a stable population of Treg cells and subsequently acquire lymphoproliferative disease and autoimmunity. in vitro, IL-2 is required to expand Treg cells and to induce their suppressive characteristics. Conversely, IL-2-based regimens can activate cellular antitumor immunity and are the mainstay of immunotherapies directed against melanoma and kidney cancers. Given the seemingly disparate effects of IL-2, the authors discuss the possibility that IL-2 may not be the optimal T-cell growth factor in vivo, but rather an inducer of self-tolerance. The authors propose that other gamma c-signaling cytokines, including IL-15, may be alternative choices for the immunotherapy of cancer.
17532464 | A novel canine lymphoma cell line: a translational and comparative model for lymphoma research. A novel canine lymphoma cell line, OSW, was established from the malignant pleural effusion of a dog with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The immunoprofile as determined by flow cytometry was as follows: positive for CD45, CD49d, CD18, CD11a; weakly positive for CD11b, CD11c, CD11d; and negative for CD45RA, CD1a, CD1c, CD3, TCRalphabeta, TCRgammadelta, CD4, CD5, CD8a, CD8b, CD90(Thy1), CD21, MHCII, CD14(TUK4), CD34, and MPO. Immunocytochemistry of cytospin preparations was negative for cytoplasmic CD3, CD79a, and MPO, but was positive for CD20. The cell line had an oligoclonal T-cell receptor gamma (TCRgamma) gene rearrangement. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and single locus probe (SLP) analysis showed that there were copy number increases of loci on dog chromosome 13 (CFA 13), and copy number decreases were evident for regions of CFA 11, 22, 26, 30 and 32, which include several of the more common chromosomal aberrations reported previously in canine lymphoma. The OSW cell line grows rapidly in vitro and is tumorigenic as a xenograft in SCID/NOD mice. OSW represents one of only a few reported canine lymphoma cell lines and is the most thoroughly characterized. This cell line and xenograft represent significant in vitro and in vivo models, respectively, for comparative and translational lymphoma research.
18367582 | Monitoring of vaccine-specific gamma interferon induction in genital mucosa of mice by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Monitoring of T-cell responses in genital mucosa has remained a major challenge because of the absence of lymphoid aggregates and the low abundance of T cells. Here we have adapted to genital tissue a sensitive real-time reverse transcription-PCR (TaqMan) method to measure induction of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA transcription after 3 h of antigen-specific activation of CD8 T cells. For this purpose, we vaccinated C57BL/6 mice subcutaneously with human papillomavirus type 16 L1 virus-like particles and monitored the induction of CD8 T cells specific to the L1(165-173) H-2D(b)-restricted epitope. Comparison of the responses induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph nodes (LN) by L1-specific IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay and TaqMan determination of the relative increase in L1-specific IFN-gamma mRNA induction normalized to the content of CD8b mRNA showed a significant correlation, despite the difference in the readouts. Most of the cervicovaginal tissues could be analyzed by the TaqMan method if normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used and a significant L1-specific IFN-gamma induction was found in one-third of the immunized mice. This local response did not correlate with the immune responses measured in the periphery, with the exception of the sacral LN, an LN draining the genital mucosa, where a significant correlation was found. Our data show that the TaqMan method is sensitive enough to detect antigen-specific CD8 T-cell responses in the genital mucosa of individual mice, and this may contribute to elaborate effective vaccines against genital pathogens.
20348006 | Experimental antibacterial therapy with puroindolines, lactoferrin and lysozyme in Listeria monocytogenes-infected mice. Puroindoline A and puroindoline B from plant seeds, bovine lactoferrin and chicken eggs lysozyme are antimicrobial proteins of innate immune system that lyse invading organisms. We investigate their potential antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes in a mouse model. Bacteria were isolated from various organs for 7 days after challenge. Livers displayed consistently higher bacterial count (up to 10(7)cfu/g) than spleens, kidneys and brains. The efficacy of the AMPs was therefore established by measuring the infection level (cfu number) of these organs. Puroindoline A and puroindoline B (5mg/mouse), lactoferrin and lysozyme (1.25mg/mouse), intravenously injected individually, inhibited bacterial growth completely. Puroindoline A, puroindoline B and lactoferrin were effective when administered 24h before infection; lysozyme was effective at the time of infection or 5 days after. Their combined use resulted in the enhancement of individual antibacterial activities. Complete inhibition of bacterial growth was observed using concurrently 0.059mg/mouse of puroindoline A and 0.019mg/mouse of puroindoline B, lactoferrin and lysozyme. Individual antimicrobial proteins reduced significantly the expression level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, INF-gamma and TNF-alpha), acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) and the T lymphocyte antigens CD4, CD8a, CD8b and CD25. These results suggest their potential use for the control of L. monocytogenes infections.
23980113 | Short-lived effector CD8 T cells induced by genetically attenuated malaria parasite vaccination express CD11c. Vaccination with a single dose of genetically attenuated malaria parasites can induce sterile protection against sporozoite challenge in the rodent Plasmodium yoelii model. Protection is dependent on CD8(+) T cells, involves perforin and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and is correlated with the expansion of effector memory CD8(+) T cells in the liver. Here, we have further characterized vaccine-induced changes in the CD8(+) T cell phenotype and demonstrated significant upregulation of CD11c on CD3(+) CD8b(+) T cells in the liver, spleen, and peripheral blood. CD11c(+) CD8(+) T cells are predominantly CD11a(hi) CD44(hi) CD62L(-), indicative of antigen-experienced effector cells. Following in vitro restimulation with malaria-infected hepatocytes, CD11c(+) CD8(+) T cells expressed inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxicity markers, including IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-2 (IL-2), perforin, and CD107a. CD11c(-) CD8(+) T cells, on the other hand, expressed negligible amounts of all inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxicity markers tested, indicating that CD11c marks multifunctional effector CD8(+) T cells. Coculture of CD11c(+), but not CD11c(-), CD8(+) T cells with sporozoite-infected primary hepatocytes significantly inhibited liver-stage parasite development. Tetramer staining for the immunodominant circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific CD8(+) T cell epitope demonstrated that approximately two-thirds of CSP-specific cells expressed CD11c at the peak of the CD11c(+) CD8(+) T cell response, but CD11c expression was lost as the CD8(+) T cells entered the memory phase. Further analyses showed that CD11c(+) CD8(+) T cells are primarily KLRG1(+) CD127(-) terminal effectors, whereas all KLRG1(-) CD127(+) memory precursor effector cells are CD11c(-) CD8(+) T cells. Together, these results suggest that CD11c marks a subset of highly inflammatory, short-lived, antigen-specific effector cells, which may play an important role in eliminating infected hepatocytes. 
24706961 | Transcriptome analysis reveals an activation of major histocompatibility complex 1 and 2 pathways in chicken trachea immunized with infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine. Infectious laryngotracheitis is an acute, contagious, upper respiratory disease of chickens caused by gallid herpes virus 1. Due to mortality rates that can reach up to 70% depending on the virulence of the virus, the disease is of great economic importance to the poultry industry. In this study, 15-d-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens were used to perform transcriptome analysis of chicken trachea immunized with infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine. Myosin and several collagen-related genes were downregulated in the immunized group, suggesting that normal function and structure may be compromised. In addition, we identified some cytokine receptors and several immune genes, such as Granzyme A (GZMA), CD4 molecule (CD4), CD8a molecule (CD8A), and CD8b molecule (CD8B), that were upregulated upon vaccination. The gene ontology analysis shows that genes included in the biological process cluster were related to antigen processing and presentation, positive regulation of immune system processes, T cell selection, and positive regulation of T cell activation. In conclusion, chicken embryo origin vaccine activation of the major histocompatibility complex 1 and 2 pathways provides insight for evaluation and design of infectious laryngotracheitis vaccines.
31228097 | Tumor growth inhibition by mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine inducing augmented CD8+ T cell immune responses. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) has been successfully used in drug delivery and biomaterial applications, but very little attention has been directed towards the potential in vivo effects of peptide-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs), specifically the potency of intravenous (IV) STEAP peptide-loaded PLGA-NP (nanovaccine) dosing and whether STEAP-specific CD8+ T cells directly play a key role in tumor inhibition. To address these concerns, syngeneic prostate cancer mouse models were established and treated with either mSTEAP peptide emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) via subcutaneous (SC) injection or mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine containing the same amount of peptide via IV or SC injection. Meanwhile, mice were treated with either CD8b mAb followed by nanovaccine treatment, free mSTEAP peptide, or empty PLGA-NPs. Immune responses in these mice were examined using cytotoxicity assays at 14 days after treatment. Tumor size and survival in various treatment groups were measured and monitored. The results demonstrated that mSTEAP peptide nanovaccine resulted in tumor inhibition by eliciting a significantly stronger CD8+ T cell immune response when compared with the controls. Moreover, the survival periods of mice treated with mSTEAP nanovaccine were significantly longer than those of mice treated with mSTEAP peptide emulsified in IFA or the treatment controls. Additionally, it was observed that the peptide nanovaccine was mainly distributed in the mouse liver and lungs after IV injection. These findings suggest that the peptide nanovaccine is a promising immunotherapeutic approach and offers a new opportunity for prostate cancer therapies.
31872049 | Migraine polygenic risk score associates with efficacy of migraine-specific drugs. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the polygenic risk score (PRS) for migraine is associated with acute and/or prophylactic migraine treatment response. METHODS: We interviewed 2,219 unrelated patients at the Danish Headache Center using a semistructured interview to diagnose migraine and assess acute and prophylactic drug response. All patients were genotyped. A PRS was calculated with the linkage disequilibrium pred algorithm using summary statistics from the most recent migraine genome-wide association study comprising ~375,000 cases and controls. The PRS was scaled to a unit corresponding to a twofold increase in migraine risk, using 929 unrelated Danish controls as reference. The association of the PRS with treatment response was assessed by logistic regression, and the predictive power of the model by area under the curve using a case-control design with treatment response as outcome. RESULTS: A twofold increase in migraine risk associates with positive response to migraine-specific acute treatment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.49]). The association between migraine risk and migraine-specific acute treatment was replicated in an independent cohort consisting of 5,616 triptan users with prescription history (OR = 3.20 [95% CI = 1.26-8.14]). No association was found for acute treatment with non-migraine-specific weak analgesics and prophylactic treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: The migraine PRS can significantly identify subgroups of patients with a higher-than-average likelihood of a positive response to triptans, which provides a first step toward genetics-based precision medicine in migraine.
32344162 | Diminished functional properties of T regulatory cells in major depressive disorder: The influence of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The properties of CD4+CD25hi T regulatory cells (Tregs), and interleukin (IL)-2 pathway were investigated in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients treated with or without selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). The frequencies of FOXP3 and pSTAT5 in peripheral Tregs were found to be diminished in untreated patients (SSRI-) versus HCs (p < .001 for both), while their percentages were increased in treated patients (SSRI+) versus untreated patients (p < .001 and p = .04). The proliferation of CD4+ T cells was higher in SSRI-MDD patients versus HCs (p = .03). The SSRI-MDD patients showed a lower concentration of supernatant TGF-beta than HCs (p = .001), while the production of TGF-beta was enhanced in SSRI+MDD versus SSRI-MDD patients (p = .003). The number of CD45RA-expressing Tregs, the expression of JAK1 and JAK3, and the levels of IL-2 and IL-10 were similar between the patients and HCs. The study results showed that untreated patients have an impaired IL-2 signaling pathway and defective Tregs, and SSRI treatment may improve the Tregs function.
32545945 | New JAK inhibitors for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease that can be associated with various pathological conditions among which arthritis is a frequent comorbidity. Based on the current pathogenetic model, development of psoriasis is mainly driven by the IL-23/IL-17A axis. Though the therapeutic armamentarium is expanding in the latest years, new therapies are needed because of the lack or loss of response or intolerance/contraindication to the currently approved drugs. The most recently developed drugs for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis specifically target cytokines, cytokine receptors, and intracellular signaling transducers that are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Janus kinase (JAK) pathway transduces signals of multiple cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-23, IL-12, IFN, IL-6, IL-17, that have resulted crucial in the induction and maintenance of psoriasis inflammation. Thereby, JAK-1, JAK-3, TYK-2 belonging to the JAK family, have been identified as valid therapeutic targets in the treatment of psoriasis. Nowadays, different JAK inhibitors have been investigated in clinical trials showing promising results in terms of efficacy and safety. In this review, we systematically collected publications and data related to JAK inhibitors used in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis providing the state-of-the-art on this new class of molecules in the treatment of these diseases.
33291717 | Discovery of a Novel Class of Covalent Dual Inhibitors Targeting the Protein Kinases BMX and BTK. The nonreceptor tyrosine TEC kinases are key regulators of the immune system and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of diverse hematological malignancies. In contrast to the substantial efforts in inhibitor development for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), specific inhibitors of the other TEC kinases, including the bone marrow tyrosine kinase on chromosome X (BMX), remain sparse. Here we present a novel class of dual BMX/BTK inhibitors, which were designed from irreversible inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK) 3 targeting a cysteine located within the solvent-exposed front region of the ATP binding pocket. Structure-guided design exploiting the differences in the gatekeeper residues enabled the achievement of high selectivity over JAK3 and certain other kinases harboring a sterically demanding residue at this position. The most active compounds inhibited BMX and BTK with apparent IC50 values in the single digit nanomolar range or below showing moderate selectivity within the TEC family and potent cellular target engagement. These compounds represent an important first step towards selective chemical probes for the protein kinase BMX.
34225727 | A computational multi-targeting approach for drug repositioning for psoriasis treatment. BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is an autoimmune inflammatory skin disease that affects 0.5-3% of the world's population and current treatment options are posed with limitations. The reduced risk of failure in clinical trials for repositioned drug candidates and the time and cost-effectiveness has popularized drug reposition and computational methods in the drug research community. RESULTS: The current study attempts to reposition approved drugs for the treatment of psoriasis by docking about 2000 approved drug molecules against fifteen selected and validated anti-psoriatic targets. The docking results showed that a good number of the dataset interacted favorably with the targets as most of them had - 11.00 to - 10.00 kcal/mol binding free energies across the targets. The percentage of the dataset with binding affinity higher than the co-crystallized ligands ranged from 34.76% (JAK-3) to 0.73% (Rac-1). It was observed that 12 out of the 0.73% outperformed all the co-crystallized ligands across the 15 studied proteins. All the 12 drugs identified are currently indicated as either antiviral or anticancer drugs and are of purine and pyrimidine nuclei. This is not surprising given that there is similarity in the mechanism of the mentioned diseases. CONCLUSION: This study, therefore, suggests that; antiviral and anticancer drugs could have anti-psoriatic effects, and molecules with purine and pyrimidine structural architecture are likely templates to consider in developing anti-psoriatic agents.
34416640 | Assessment on the lung injury of mice posed by airborne PM2.5 collected from developing area in China and associated molecular mechanisms by integrated analysis of mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq. Some epidemiological evidences showed exposure of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was associated with lung dysfunction. However, the adverse effects of PM2.5 from mid-scale city of China on the respiratory system were unknown. Correspondingly, the mechanisms, especially the epigenetic mechanism regulated by miRNAs, involved in PM2.5-induced lung injury has not been fully understood. In this study, male Balb/C mice were exposed to PM2.5 collected from mid-scale city (Baoji), China for 8 weeks (mean concentration 298.52 +- 25.86 mug/m3 at exposure chamber) using a whole-body exposure system. The carbon component was the main ingredient (45.80%) of PM2.5 followed by ions (43.19%). Meanwhile, the sum concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and n-alkanes (C18-C33) were 570.48 and 2029.13 ng/m3 in the exposure chamber, respectively. Obvious lung injury including pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis (p < 0.05 compared with the control) were found from PM2.5 exposure group determined by micro-CT and histopathological assays, respectively, suggesting the health risk posed by PM2.5 from mid-scale city of China should be concerned. The integrated analysis between mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq revealed the differentially expression genes in lung tissues were enriched in immune pathways including B cell receptor signaling (p = 0.078) and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (p = 0.0068). The expression profiles of the genes and corresponding mRNAs involved into the immune pathways determined by RT-qPCR analysis were consistent with them conducted by transcriptome. Moreover, the expression levels of the proteins (i.e., CD19, CD81, PIK3CD, and CD22) involved into B cell receptor signaling pathway from exposure group were 1.71- to 6.948- folds compared with the control, validating the results of the genes expression profiles. Further, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and multiple correlation analysis between the target genes and components of PM2.5 documented the organic compounds (i.e., Benzo(a)pyrene (p = 0.012) and octadecane (p = 0.05)) and inorganic elements (i.e., Cl-, Ti, Al, and Zn) was the key environmental factors. Cd19, Pik3cd, and Cd8b1 might be the key genes for lung dysfunction induced by PM2.5 illuminated using interactive analysis (p < 0.05). This work for the first time showed the adverse effects of PM2.5 in mid-scale city in China on respiratory system should be concerned, and the associated epigenetic mechanism regulated by miRNA were revealed. These results may provide new insight into the development of future assessment on the air pollution associated respiratory disease.
34471993 | Selectivity Profile of the Tyrosine Kinase 2 Inhibitor Deucravacitinib Compared with Janus Kinase 1/2/3 Inhibitors. INTRODUCTION: Deucravacitinib, a novel, oral, selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) signaling, acts via an allosteric mechanism by binding to the enzyme's regulatory domain instead of the catalytic domain. This unique binding provides high functional selectivity for TYK2 versus the closely related Janus kinases (JAKs) 1/2/3. Deucravacitinib was efficacious in phase 2 and 3 psoriasis trials, without clinical or laboratory parameters indicative of JAK 1/2/3 inhibition being observed. This analysis compared the kinase specificities of deucravacitinib versus JAK 1/2/3 inhibitors at therapeutic exposures. METHODS: Signaling via JAK 1/3, JAK 2/2, and TYK2/JAK 2 dimers was measured in in vitro whole blood assays. Concentrations providing half-maximal inhibition (IC50) in these assays were determined for deucravacitinib and the JAK 1/2/3 inhibitors tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and baricitinib. Newly derived whole blood IC50 values were plotted against available pharmacokinetic profiles using doses evaluated in phase 2/3 trials. Simulated average daily inhibition and durations over which concentrations exceeded IC50 were evaluated. RESULTS: At clinically relevant exposures, projected steady-state deucravacitinib plasma concentrations were higher than TYK2 IC50 for approximately 9-18 h. Maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of deucravacitinib were 8- to 17-fold lower than JAK 1/3 IC50 and > 48- to > 102-fold lower than JAK 2/2 IC50. Simulated daily average TYK2 inhibition by deucravacitinib ranged from 50% to 69%. Simulations indicated that tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and baricitinib at steady state exhibited varying degrees of JAK 1/3 (daily average inhibition, 70-94%) and JAK 2/2 (23%-67%) inhibition at therapeutic concentrations, with Cmax values 17- to 33-fold lower than their TYK2 IC50 levels. CONCLUSION: At clinically relevant doses and exposures, deucravacitinib demonstrates highly selective inhibition of TYK2 and not JAK 1/2/3. Tofacitinib, upadacitinib, and baricitinib variably inhibit JAK 1/2/3 but not TYK2. These results indicate that deucravacitinib is a distinct class of kinase inhibitor compared with JAK 1/2/3 inhibitors.
34826225 | Ritlecitinib: an investigational drug for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata. INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata (AA) is an inflammatory and autoimmune form of hair loss, which can present with one patch of hair loss, but in more extreme cases can lead to total body hair loss. There are limited therapeutic options and no cure, but medication can sometimes induce sustained remission. Disease control cannot be guaranteed; even those who regrow all hair on treatment can experience relapse. There are no FDA approved systemic treatments; therefore, an unmet need for safe, and effective treatments exists. Few treatments have been evaluated by randomized controlled trials. Case reports and series indicate oral Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors as a potential therapy. Ritlecitinib is a novel oral JAK3-selective inhibitor being investigated as an AA treatment. AREAS COVERED: This article introduces ritlecitinib as treatment for AA and considers the mechanism of action, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and safety [reporting data from a 24-week, phase 2a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial of ritlecitinib in patients with AA who have more than 50% scalp hair loss]. EXPERT OPINION: Ritlecitinib offers a novel mode of action, rapid onset, and the capacity for a superior safety profile over other JAK inhibitors. If approved, ritlecitinib will be widely prescribed by physicians overseeing the more severe AA patients for the foreseeable future. As JAK inhibitors regulate the hair growth cycle and have anti-inflammatory effects, the implementation of ritlecitinib in hair loss disorders other than AA, may prove beneficial.
35020848 | The autoimmune encephalitis-related cytokine TSLP in the brain primes neuroinflammation by activating the JAK2-NLRP3 axis. NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation contributes to neuroinflammation in autoimmune disorders, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that compared with wild-type (WT) mice, mice lacking thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor (TSLPR) (Tslpr-/- mice) exhibit a significantly decreased experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) score, reduced CD4+ T cell infiltration, and restored myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the brain after EAE induction by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein35-55 (MOG35-55). TSLPR signals through Janus kinase (JAK)2, but not JAK1 or JAK3, to induce NLRP3 expression, and Tslpr-/- mice with EAE show decreased JAK2 phosphorylation and NLRP3 expression in the brain. JAK2 inhibition by ruxolitinib mimicked loss of TSLPR function in vivo and further decreased TSLP expression in the EAE mouse brain. The NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 decreased CD4+ T cell infiltration, restored MBP expression, and decreased IL-1beta and TSLP levels, verifying the pro-inflammatory role of NLRP3. In vitro experiments using BV-2 murine microglia revealed that TSLP directly induced NLRP3 expression, phosphorylation of JAK2 but not JAK1orJAK3, and IL-1beta release, which were markedly inhibited by ruxolitinib. Furthermore, EAE induction led to an increase in the Th17 cell number, a decrease in the regulatory T (Treg) cell number in the blood, and an increase in the expression of the cytokine IL-17A in the WT mouse brain, which was drastically reversed in Tslpr-/- mice. In addition, ruxolitinib suppressed the increase in IL-17A expression in the EAE mouse brain. These findings identify TSLP as a prospective target for treating JAK2-NLRP3 axis-associated autoimmune inflammatory disorders.
35300210 | Mannan-Binding Lectin Regulates the Th17/Treg Axis Through JAK/STAT and TGF-beta/SMAD Signaling Against Candida albicans Infection. Background: Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a key molecule in innate immunity and activates the lectin complement pathway, which plays an important role in resisting Candida albicans (C. albicans) infection. However, the underlying mechanism of this resistance to infection remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we investigated how MBL regulates the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into T helper type 17 (Th17) and T regulatory (Treg) cells against C. albicans in mice, as well as the underlying mechanisms. We generated MBL double-knockout (KO) mice and infected them with C. albicans by intraperitoneal injection. Results: Compared with that in wild-type (WT) mice, the percentage of Th17 cells increased in MBL-null mice, whereas Treg cells decreased, indicating that MBL might regulate the Th17/Treg balance. In addition, in MBL-null mice, the expression levels of interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-21, and the master transcription factor of Th17 cells, RORgammat, significantly increased. Conversely, IL-10, IL-2, and the Treg-specific transcription factor, Foxp3, decreased. Moreover, we found that the levels of TGF-beta and IL-6 upregulated in MBL-null mice. Mechanistically, we found that MBL regulated the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway through the inhibition of p-SMAD2 and promotion of p-SMAD3, and mediated the JAK/STAT pathway through the inhibition of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 and promotion of p-JAK3 and p-STAT5. MBL double-KO mice showed a more severe inflammatory response and significantly lower survival rates with C. albicans infection. Conclusion: These results suggest that MBL regulates the Th17/Treg cell balance to inhibit inflammatory responses, possibly via IL-6- and TGF-beta-mediated JAK/STAT and TGF-beta/SMAD signaling, and play an important role in anti-C. albicans infection.
35734412 | Novel Diagnostic and Therapeutic Options for KMT2A-Rearranged Acute Leukemias. The KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements (KMT2A-r) are associated with a diverse spectrum of acute leukemias. Although most KMT2A-r are restricted to nine partner genes, we have recently revealed that KMT2A-USP2 fusions are often missed during FISH screening of these genetic alterations. Therefore, complementary methods are important for appropriate detection of any KMT2A-r. Here we use a machine learning model to unravel the most appropriate markers for prediction of KMT2A-r in various types of acute leukemia. A Random Forest and LightGBM classifier was trained to predict KMT2A-r in patients with acute leukemia. Our results revealed a set of 20 genes capable of accurately estimating KMT2A-r. The SKIDA1 (AUC: 0.839; CI: 0.799-0.879) and LAMP5 (AUC: 0.746; CI: 0.685-0.806) overexpression were the better markers associated with KMT2A-r compared to CSPG4 (also named NG2; AUC: 0.722; CI: 0.659-0.784), regardless of the type of acute leukemia. Of importance, high expression levels of LAMP5 estimated the occurrence of all KMT2A-USP2 fusions. Also, we performed drug sensitivity analysis using IC50 data from 345 drugs available in the GDSC database to identify which ones could be used to treat KMT2A-r leukemia. We observed that KMT2A-r cell lines were more sensitive to 5-Fluorouracil (5FU), Gemcitabine (both antimetabolite chemotherapy drugs), WHI-P97 (JAK-3 inhibitor), Foretinib (MET/VEGFR inhibitor), SNX-2112 (Hsp90 inhibitor), AZD6482 (PI3Kbeta inhibitor), KU-60019 (ATM kinase inhibitor), and Pevonedistat (NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor). Moreover, IC50 data from analyses of ex-vivo drug sensitivity to small-molecule inhibitors reveals that Foretinib is a promising drug option for AML patients carrying FLT3 activating mutations. Thus, we provide novel and accurate options for the diagnostic screening and therapy of KMT2A-r leukemia, regardless of leukemia subtype.
35844366 | Identifying significant genes and functionally enriched pathways in familial hypercholesterolemia using integrated gene co-expression network analysis. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic lipid disorder which promotes atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Owing to the lack of sufficient published information, this study aims to identify the potential genetic biomarkers for FH by studying the global gene expression profile of blood cells. The microarray expression data of FH patients and controls was analyzed by different computational biology methods like differential expression analysis, protein network mapping, hub gene identification, functional enrichment of biological pathways, and immune cell restriction analysis. Our results showed the dysregulated expression of 115 genes connected to lipid homeostasis, immune responses, cell adhesion molecules, canonical Wnt signaling, mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis pathways in FH patients. The findings from expanded protein interaction network construction with known FH genes and subsequent Gene Ontology (GO) annotations have also supported the above findings, in addition to identifying the involvement of dysregulated thyroid hormone and ErbB signaling pathways in FH patients. The genes like CSNK1A1, JAK3, PLCG2, RALA, and ZEB2 were found to be enriched under all GO annotation categories. The subsequent phenotype ontology results have revealed JAK3I, PLCG2, and ZEB2 as key hub genes contributing to the inflammation underlying cardiovascular and immune response related phenotypes. Immune cell restriction findings show that above three genes are highly expressed by T-follicular helper CD4+ T cells, naive B cells, and monocytes, respectively. These findings not only provide a theoretical basis to understand the role of immune dysregulations underlying the atherosclerosis among FH patients but may also pave the way to develop genomic medicine for cardiovascular diseases.
35875095 | Case Report: Mature Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Proliferation Associated With a Lymphoid Neoplasm. Mature plasmacytoid dendritic cell proliferations (MPDCPs) are clonal, non-malignant pDC proliferations that have been reported to occur in association with myeloid neoplasms such as CMML, AML (pDC-AML), and, rarely, MDS or MPNs. Here we report the first case of a MPDCP associated with T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a lymphoid neoplasm. The MPDCP in this case involved ~50% of the bone marrow, was found in nodular aggregates, expressed CD123, CD4, and CD303, and lacked CD56 and TCL1 expression. In addition, the MPDCP lacked CD34 and TdT but showed aberrant expression of CD7, CD5, CD10, and CD13, markers expressed by the abnormal T-lymphoblastic cells. Mutational analysis demonstrated mutations in JAK3, NOTCH1, NRAS, KRAS, DNMT3A, and SH2B3 but no mutations in TET2, ASLX1 or ZRSR2. Analysis of the pDC frequency in a separate cohort of T-ALL and control patients demonstrated that bone marrow pDCs are often decreased in patients with T-ALL compared to controls. This is the first report of a MPDCP associated with a lymphoid neoplasm and provides further support that MPDCP can arise from a multipotent hematopoietic progenitor with lymphoid and dendritic cell potential.
35944186 | The role of Th9 CD4+ T cells and IL-9 during primary Sjogren's syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the expression levels of Th9 CD4+ T cells and IL-9 secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Further, this study aimed to investigate the role of Th9 cells in the occurrence and development of pSS. METHODS: A total of 20 pSS patients and 20 healthy people, matched with age and gender, were selected as the experimental and control group, respectively. Flow cytometry and ELISA were used to detect the expression of Th9 cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and IL-9 in serum, respectively. These factors were then correlated to other clinical indicators. RESULTS: The levels of Th9 CD4+ T cells and IL-9 of pSS patients were significantly higher than those of the control group. Th9 CD4+ T cells and IL-9 levels in peripheral blood of pSS patients were negatively correlated with salivary flow rate, while IL-9 level was positively correlated with globulin. The transcription levels of IL-9 and immune-related genes including IL-4, IL-7, IL-17, SMAD3, STAT5 and JAK3 were dramatically increased in serum of pSS patients. CONCLUSION: The expression levels of Th9 in peripheral blood and serum IL-9 of patients with pSS were significantly increased, which were correlated with clinical immunological indexes. Together, these data suggest that Th9 cells and IL-9 may be involved in the pathogenesis of pSS.
36349652 | Interleukin (IL)-22 in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.): Immune modulation, antibacterial defense, and activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Interleukin (IL)-22 is an IL-10 family cytokine secreted by CD4+ T cells and plays an important role in regulating inflammation and infection elimination. IL-22 homologues have been reported in the teleost, but the functions of IL-22 are still unclear. In this study, we identified two duplicated IL-22 genes in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), termed Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B. Sequence analysis showed that Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B had four conserved cysteine residues, which could form two intra-chain disulfide bridges. The Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B were constitutively expressed in various tissues, with the highest expression in the gill. The mRNA expression levels of Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B were significantly up-regulated in the gill, intestine, head kidney, and spleen of common carp challenged with Aeromonas. hydrophila. In vivo study showed that the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly up-regulated in the head kidney and spleen when Cc_IL-22A or Cc_IL-22B were over-expressed. Furthermore, the over-expression of Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B indicated a protective effect on tissues, with only lymphocytic infiltration observed in comparison to the control and pcN3 groups, without obvious change in tissue morphology. Similar stimulatory effects of rIL-22A and rIL-22B were observed in vitro. When HKLs were stimulated with rIL-22A or rIL-22B, the expression levels of critical signaling molecules in the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway were significantly induced, including JAK1, JAK3, STAT1, and STAT3, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha). Together, these results suggest that Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B may regulate inflammatory responses through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and have a significant impact on the immune defense of common carp against bacterial infection. Therefore, our study provides a new perspective on the functions of Cc_IL-22A and Cc_IL-22B in the immune defense mechanism of fish.
36913180 | Safety of Janus Kinase Inhibitors in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. In recent years, better knowledge of the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has led to a relevant expansion of the therapeutic arsenal for these conditions. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are a family of small molecules that block one or more of the intracellular tyrosine kinases, including JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3 and TYK-2. Tofacitinib, a non-selective small molecule JAK inhibitor, and upadacitinib and filgotinib, which are selective JAK-1 inhibitors, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. Compared to biological drugs, JAK inhibitors have a short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no immunogenicity. Both clinical trials and real-world evidence support the use of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of IBD. However, these therapies have been linked with multiple adverse events (AEs) including infection, hypercholesterolemia, venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and malignancy. While early studies recognized several potential AEs, post-marketing trials have shown that tofacitinib may increase the risk of thromboembolic diseases and major cardiovascular events. The latter are seen in patients aged 50 years or older with cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, the benefits of treatment and risk stratification need to be considered when positioning tofacitinib. Novel JAK inhibitors with a more selective effect on JAK-1 have proven to be effective in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, offering a potentially safer and efficacious therapeutic option to patients, including those with previous non-response to other therapies such as biologics. Nevertheless, long-term effectiveness and safety data are required.
37001436 | Single-cell analysis highlights a population of Th17-polarized CD4+ naive T cells showing IL6/JAK3/STAT3 activation in pediatric severe aplastic anemia. Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is recognized as an immune-mediated disorder resulting from active destruction of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow (BM) by effector T lymphocytes. Bulk genomic landscape analysis and transcriptomic profiling have contributed to a better understanding of the recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and immunologic cues associated with the onset of hematopoietic destruction. However, the functional mechanistic determinants underlying the complexity of heterogeneous T lymphocyte populations as well as their correlation with clinical outcomes remain to be elucidated. To uncover dysfunctional mechanisms acting within the heterogeneous marrow-infiltrating immune environment and examine their pathogenic interplay with the hematopoietic stem/progenitor pool, we exploited single-cell mass cytometry for BM mononuclear cells of severe AA (SAA) patients pre- and post-immunosuppressive therapy, in contrast to those of healthy donors. Alignment of BM cellular composition with hematopoietic developmental trajectories revealed potential functional roles for non-canonically activated CD4+ naive T cells in newly-diagnosed pediatric cases of SAA. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic profiling highlighted a population of Th17-polarized CD4+CAMK4+ naive T cells showing activation of the IL-6/JAK3/STAT3 pathway, while gene signature dissection indicated a predisposition to proinflammatory pathogenesis. Retrospective validation from our SAA cohort of 231 patients revealed high plasma levels of IL-6 as an independent risk factor of delayed hematopoietic response to antithymocyte globulin-based immunosuppressive therapy. Thus, IL-6 warrants further investigation as a putative therapeutic target in SAA.
37461925 | P004 Steroid-Free Remission in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis Receiving Tofacitinib in Real Clinical Practice. BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is a selective immunosuppressant, the first representative of the inhibitors of the janus kinase family, which has high selectivity against other kinases of the human genome. According to the results of the study, tofacitinib inhibits JAK-1, JAK-2, and in high concentrations - JAK-3 and tyrosine kinase-2. The drug is registered in Russia for the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis. According to the OCTAVE Sustain study, steroid-free remission in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving tofacitinib at a dose of 10 and 20 mg per day is 27.7% and 27.6%, respectively. OBJECTIVE: To identify the frequency of steroid-free remission in patients with ulcerative colitis receiving tofacitinib in real clinical practice. METHODS: In the Department of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases of the Moscow Clinical Scientific and Practical Center named after A. S. Loginov, 58 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who received tofacitinib were observed. The effectiveness of therapy was evaluated (the value of the Mayo index less than 2, ESR, CRP, hemoglobin, fecal calprotectin (FCP) and the need for the appointment of glucocorticosteroids (GCS). The follow-up period was 12 months from the start of tofacitinib therapy. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, out of 58 (100%) UC patients treated with tofacitinib, 9 (15.5%) patients did not respond to therapy. A prolonged induction course at a dose of 20 mg of tofacitinib was required in 14 (24.1%) patients who had previously received anti-TNF-alpha drugs. All patients at the time of initiation received GCS at an average therapeutic dose of 40 mg. After the induction course, corticosteroids were discontinued in 49 (100%) patients who responded to treatment. All patients achieved remission within 12 months of therapy (Meyo < 2). Repeated administration of corticosteroids for exacerbation or \eluding\ of the response to tofacitinib was required in 11 of 49 (22.4%) patients. CONCLUSION: Steroid-free remission in patients with ulcerative colitis, receiving tofacitinib for 12 months, in real clinical practice is 77.6%.
37624299 | Immunolocalization and Expression of JAK1 and JAK3 in the Skin of Dust Mite-Sensitive Beagle Dogs before and after Allergen Exposure. Janus kinase (JAK) pathways have emerged as targets of treatment, yet localization and expression of JAK1 and JAK3 in canine atopic skin have not been studied. This study aimed to compare the localization and expression of JAK1 and JAK3 in the skin of atopic dogs before and after allergen exposure. Skin biopsies taken from atopic beagles sensitized to house dust mites (HDM) before (D0) and after four weeks (D28) of allergen exposure were stained. Staining was subjectively scored by examiners unaware of the source of the slides. Image J was used for the semiquantitative assessment of staining intensity. JAK1 and JAK3 staining was epidermal and dermal. JAK1 staining was cytoplasmic, primarily found in basal keratinocytes and dermal cells, while JAK 3 was nuclear (all epidermal levels and on dermal inflammatory cells). Epidermal thickness was significantly higher on D28 than on D0 (p < 0.0001). For JAK1, epidermal staining divided by epithelial thickness was significantly lower on D28 (p = 0.0002) compared to D0. For JAK3 staining, intensity in the dermis was significantly higher on D28 (p = 0.0405) compared to D0. We conclude that decreased expression of JAK1 in the epidermis and increased expression of JAK3 in the dermis of atopic dogs occur after allergen exposure.
37720295 | Molecular docking analysis of Indole based diaza-sulphonamides with JAK-3 protein. JAK-3 gene is a part of an important signalling pathway in oral cancer. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the inhibitory properties of new indole based diaza-sulphonamides compounds against JAK3 gene. Molecular docking analysis showed that among the selected compounds (1-9), the compounds 1-4 turned out to be the most potentially capable ones to be used as ant-cancer drugs. Also, they are proved to be non-toxic.
37855324 | Janus kinase inhibitors differentially inhibit specific cytokine signals in the mesenteric lymph node cells of IBD patients. BACKGROUND: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKinibs) are effective small molecule therapies for treating Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). By preventing JAKs from phosphorylating signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins, JAKinibs disrupt cytokine signaling pathways that promote inflammation. Despite considerable overlap in the JAKs they target, first and second generation JAKinibs display different clinical efficacies in CD and UC. METHODS: We conducted a comparative phosflow study of four JAKinibs (filgotinib, upadacitinib, tofacitinib, and deucravacitinib) to observe subtle mechanistic differences that may dictate their clinical behavior. Resected mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells from 19 patients (9 CD, 10 UC) were analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence or absence of different cytokine stimuli and titrated JAKinibs. RESULTS: We found a higher potency of the JAK 1/3-preferential inhibitor, tofacitinib, for JAK 3-dependent cytokine signaling pathways in comparison to filgotinib, but a higher potency of the JAK 1-preferential inhibitors, filgotinib and upadacitinib, for JAK 3-independent cytokine signaling pathways. Deucravacitinib, a TYK2-preferential inhibitor, demonstrated a much narrower selectivity by inhibiting only IL-10 and IFN-betapathways, albeit more potently than the other JAKinibs . Additionally, we found some differences in the sensitivity of immune cells from CD versus UC and patients with versus without a CD-associated NOD2 polymorphism to phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcriptions in response to specific cytokine stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their similarities, differences exist in the relative potencies of different JAKinibs against distinct cytokine families to explain their clinical efficacy.
37989057 | HDAC specificity and kinase off-targeting by purine-benzohydroxamate anti-hematological tumor agents. A series of hybrid inhibitors, combining pharmacophores of known kinase inhibitors bearing anilino-purines (ruxolitinib, ibrutinib) and benzohydroxamate HDAC inhibitors (nexturastat A), were generated in the present study. The compounds have been synthesized and tested against solid and hematological tumor cell lines. Compounds 4d-f were the most promising in cytotoxicity assays (IC50 <= 50 nM) vs. hematological cells and displayed moderate activity in solid tumor models (EC50 = 9.3-21.7 muM). Compound 4d potently inhibited multiple kinase targets of interest for anticancer effects, including JAK2, JAK3, HDAC1, and HDAC6. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that 4d has stable interactions with HDAC and members of the JAK family, with differences in the hinge binding energy conferring selectivity for JAK3 and JAK2 over JAK1. The kinase inhibition profile of compounds 4d-f allows selective cytotoxicity, with minimal effects on non-tumorigenic cells. Moreover, these compounds have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, with high stability in human liver microsomes (e.g., see t1/2: >120 min for 4f), low intrinsic clearance, and lack of significant inhibition of four major CYP450 isoforms.
38141256 | Baseline serum and stool microbiome biomarkers predict clinical efficacy and tissue molecular response after ritlecitinib induction therapy in ulcerative colitis. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ritlecitinib, an oral JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor, was well- tolerated and efficacious in the phase 2b VIBRATO study in participants with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). The aim of this study was to identify baseline serum and microbiome markers that predict subsequent clinical efficacy and to develop noninvasive serum signatures as potential real-time noninvasive surrogates of clinical efficacy after ritlecitinib. METHODS: Tissue and peripheral blood proteomics, transcriptomics, and fecal metagenomics were performed on samples before and after 8-week oral ritlecitinib induction therapy (20 mg, 70 mg, 200 mg, or placebo once daily, N=39, 41, 33, and 18, respectively). Linear mixed models were used to identify baseline and longitudinal protein markers associated with efficacy. The combined predictivity of these proteins was evaluated using a logistic model with permuted efficacy data. Differential expression of fecal metagenomic was used to differentiate responders and nonresponders. RESULTS: Peripheral blood serum proteomics identified 4 baseline serum markers (LTA, CCL21, HLA-E, MEGF10) predictive of modified clinical remission (MR), endoscopic improvement (EI), histologic remission (HR), and integrative score of tissue molecular improvement. In responders, 37 serum proteins significantly changed at Week 8 compared with baseline (FDR<0.05); of these, changes in 4 (IL4R, TNFRSF4, SPINK4, and LAIR-1) predicted concurrent EI and HR responses. Fecal metagenomics analysis revealed baseline and treatment response signatures that correlated with EI, MR, and tissue molecular improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Blood and microbiome biomarkers stratify endoscopic, histologic, and tissue molecular response to ritlecitinib, which may help guide future precision medicine approaches to UC treatment.
38169088 | European expert consensus statement on the systemic treatment of alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune form of non-scarring hair loss. It is usually characterized by limited areas of hair loss. However, the disease may progress to complete scalp and body hair loss (alopecia totalis, alopecia universalis). In patients with alopecia areata hair loss significantly impacts the quality of life. Children and adolescents with alopecia areata often experience bullying, including physical aggression. The disease severity evaluation tools used in clinical practice are: the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score and the Alopecia Areata Scale (AAS). A SALT score equal to or greater than 20 constitutes a commonly accepted indication for systemic therapy in alopecia areata. When using the AAS, moderate to severe alopecia areata should be considered a medical indication for systemic treatment. Currently, the only two EMA-approved medications for alopecia areata are baricitinib (JAK 1/2 inhibitor) for adults and ritlecitinib (JAK 3/TEC inhibitor) for individuals aged 12 and older. Both are EMA-approved for patients with severe alopecia areata. Other systemic medications used off-label in alopecia areata include glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporine, methotrexate and azathioprine. Oral minoxidil is considered an adjuvant therapy with limited data confirming its possible efficacy. This consensus statement is to outline a systemic treatment algorithm for alopecia areata, indications for systemic treatment, available therapeutic options, their efficacy and safety, as well as the duration of the therapy.
38265448 | Tofacitinib: A Treatment Option for Recalcitrant Polymorphic Light Eruption and Its Mechanistic Rationale. Background: Polymorphous light eruption is largely characterized by a delayed-type (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction to 1 or more undefined endogenous ultraviolet-induced skin antigens. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of tofacitinib in refractory cases of polymorphous light eruption. Methods: Seven patients who had failed multiple systemic treatments or relapsed within 2 weeks of existing systemic agents with concomitant photoprotection were offered tofacitinib after written consent. Results: Initiation of tofacitinib led to a marked reduction of itching (mean +- SD 3.1 +- 1.12 days) followed by clinical resolution (mean +- SD 2.6 +- 1.1 weeks). The duration of therapy ranged from 1 to 3 months (mean +- SD 2 +- 0.63 months), and 4 of 7 patients had a recurrence in 5.5 weeks and were again initiated on tofacitinib with a prompt response. Conclusion: Tofacitinib inhibits Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK3 thus it can abrogate the effects of the predominant cytokine milieu of polymorphic light eruption (PMLE) and thus reduce the expression of aberrant inflammatory T lymphocyte expression in PMLE.
38279559 | Comparative efficacy of oral Janus kinase inhibitors and biologics in adult alopecia areata: A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis. Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the hair follicles, resulting in patchy recurrent hair loss. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the favourable clinical response of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and biologics, but a lack of comprehensive comparison among these therapies exists in the current literature. This study aimed to compare their efficacy. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed including randomized trials that report the outcomes of the Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT)50 and/or the mean change in SALT. These articles were pooled and a network meta-analysis (NAM) was conducted. Based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve estimates obtained for the mean change in SALT score, baricitinib_4 mg (0.7949656) had the best probability of being the most effective therapy, followed by ritlecitinib_200_50 mg (0.7391906) and ivarmacitinib_4 mg (0.7292594). In contrast, dupilumab, secukinumab, tralokinumab and apremilast were less likely to be effective. Targeting the JAK signalling pathway holds great potential for restoring hair regrowth, albeit the contribution of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 inhibition to the therapeutic effect on AA is apparently different. Baricitinib_4 mg and ritlecitinib 200_50 mg demonstrated notable efficacy, and both molecules displayed a dose-dependent effect, which is not observed with ivarmacitinib. Further investigations into the specific mechanisms of action of these JAK inhibitors are warranted to elucidate the reasons behind these differences.
38467779 | TYK2: an emerging therapeutic target in rheumatic disease. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the JAK kinase family of intracellular signalling molecules. By participating in signalling pathways downstream of type I interferons, IL-12, IL-23 and IL-10, TYK2 elicits a distinct set of immune events to JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3. TYK2 polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to various rheumatic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis. In vitro and animal studies substantiate these findings, highlighting a role for TYK2 in diseases currently managed by antagonists of cytokines that signal through TYK2. Various inhibitors of TYK2 have now been studied in human disease, and one of these inhibitors, deucravacitinib, has now been approved for the treatment of psoriasis. Phase II trials of deucravacitinib have also reported positive results in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, with a preliminary safety profile that seems to differ from that of the JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 inhibitors. Two other inhibitors of TYK2, brepocitinib and ropsacitinib, are also in earlier stages of clinical trials. Overall, TYK2 inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of a distinct spectrum of autoimmune diseases and could potentially have a safety profile that differs from other JAK inhibitors.
38474223 | Janus Kinase 3 (JAK3): A Critical Conserved Node in Immunity Disrupted in Immune Cell Cancer and Immunodeficiency. The Janus kinase (JAK) family is a small group of protein tyrosine kinases that represent a central component of intracellular signaling downstream from a myriad of cytokine receptors. The JAK3 family member performs a particularly important role in facilitating signal transduction for a key set of cytokine receptors that are essential for immune cell development and function. Mutations that impact JAK3 activity have been identified in a number of human diseases, including somatic gain-of-function (GOF) mutations associated with immune cell malignancies and germline loss-of-function (LOF) mutations associated with immunodeficiency. The structure, function and impacts of both GOF and LOF mutations of JAK3 are highly conserved, making animal models highly informative. This review details the biology of JAK3 and the impact of its perturbation in immune cell-related diseases, including relevant animal studies.
38528257 | Early and Sustained Improvements in Symptoms and Quality of Life with Upadacitinib in Adults and Adolescents with Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis: 52-Week Results from Two Phase III Randomized Clinical Trials (Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2). BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by increased itch, skin pain, poor sleep quality, and other symptoms that negatively affect patient quality of life. Upadacitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with greater inhibitory potency for JAK1 than JAK2, JAK3, or tyrosine kinase 2, is approved to treat moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effect of upadacitinib on patient-reported outcomes over 52 weeks in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. METHODS: Data from two phase III monotherapy trials of upadacitinib (Measure Up 1, NCT03569293; Measure Up 2, NCT03607422) were integrated. Changes in pruritus, pain, other skin symptoms, sleep, quality of life, mental health, and patient impression were evaluated. Patient-reported outcome assessments included the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure, Dermatology Life Quality Index, Atopic Dermatitis Symptom Scale, Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index, Patient Global Impression of Severity, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Patient Global Impression of Treatment. Minimal clinically important differences, achievement of scores representing minimal disease burden, and the change from baseline were evaluated in patients who received upadacitinib through week 52 and in patients who received placebo through week 16. RESULTS: This analysis included 1609 patients (upadacitinib 15 mg, N = 557; upadacitinib 30 mg, N = 567; placebo, N = 485). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were generally similar across all arms. The proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib reporting improvements in itch increased rapidly by week 1, increased steadily through week 8, and was sustained through week 52. Patients receiving upadacitinib also experienced improvements in pain and other skin symptoms by week 1, which continued through week 16; improvements were maintained through week 52. Patient reports of improved sleep increased rapidly from baseline to week 1, increased steadily through week 32, and were sustained through week 52. Patients experienced quality-of-life improvements through week 8, which were maintained through week 52. By week 1, patients in both upadacitinib groups experienced rapid improvements in emotional state, and by week 12, patients also achieved meaningful improvements in anxiety and depression. Improvements in mental health continued steadily through week 32 and were maintained through week 52. Patients treated with upadacitinib 30 mg generally experienced improvements in patient-reported outcomes earlier than those treated with upadacitinib 15 mg. Through week 16, patients receiving upadacitinib experienced greater improvements versus those receiving placebo in all assessed patient-reported outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis treated with once-daily upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg experienced early improvements in itch, pain, other skin symptoms, sleep, quality of life, and mental health that were sustained through week 52. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT03569293 (13 August 2018) and NCT03607422 (27 July 2018).
38530663 | Effectiveness of tofacitinib monotherapy for patients with IgG4-RD or idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To explore the effectiveness of tofacitinib for immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) and idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRF), and investigate the expression of JAKs in the lesion of these diseases. METHODS: Clinical data of patients with IgG4-RD or IRF who were administered with tofacitinib monotherapy were collected. IgG4-RD responder index (IgG4-RD RI) was assessed. The expression of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 were analysed with immunohistochemistry staining in three salivary glands specimens of IgG4-RD and one retroperitoneal tissue of IRF. RESULTS: Two patients with IRF and two patients with IgG4-RD used tofacitinib monotherapy. Two patients with IRF achieved complete remission with diminished retroperitoneal mass and decreased CRP, as IgG4-RD RI decreased from 6 to 1 in both of them. One with IgG4-RD achieved complete remission with alleviated enlargement of pancreas and IgG4 level decreased from 13.7 g/L to 2.4 g/L, as IgG4-RD RI decreased from 12 to 1. One with IgG4-RD achieved partial response with IgG4 level decreased from 77.1g/L to 25.8g/L as IgG4-RD RI from 18 to 6. JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 expression were detected in biopsy tissues. The staining intensity of the JAK family on the lesion from one IRF patient was similar to those from IgG4-RD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib is a potentially effective treatment for IgG4-RD and IRF and it is reasonable to conduct clinical trial to validate its efficacy. The JAKs were expressed in the inflammatory lesions of IgG4-RD and IRF and they may share a common pathogenesis pathway that is independent of IgG4 production.
38558990 | Induction of complementary immunogenic necroptosis and apoptosis cell death pathways inhibits cancer metastasis and relapse. Interactions of light-sensitive drugs and materials with Cerenkov radiation-emitting radiopharmaceuticals generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) to inhibit localized and disseminated cancer progression, but the cell death mechanisms underlying this radionuclide stimulated dynamic therapy (RaST) remain elusive. Using ROS-regenerative nanophotosensitizers coated with a tumor-targeting transferrin-titanocene complex (TiO2-TC-Tf) and radiolabeled 2-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG), we found that adherent dying cells maintained metabolic activity with increased membrane permeabilization. Mechanistic assessment of these cells revealed that RaST activated the expression of RIPK-1 and RIPK-3, which mediate necroptosis cell death. Subsequent recruitment of the nuclear factors kappa B and the executioner mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudo kinase (MLKL) triggered plasma membrane permeabilization and pore formation, respectively, followed by the release of cytokines and immunogenic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In immune-deficient breast cancer models with adequate stroma and growth factors that recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment, RaST failed to inhibit tumor progression and the ensuing lung metastasis. A similar aggressive tumor model in immunocompetent mice responded to RaST, achieving a remarkable partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) with no evidence of lung metastasis, suggesting active immune system engagement. RaST recruited antitumor CD11b+, CD11c+, and CD8b+ effector immune cells after initiating dual immunogenic apoptosis and necroptosis cell death pathways in responding tumors in vivo. Over time, cancer cells upregulated the expression of negative immune regulating cytokine (TGF-beta) and soluble immune checkpoints (sICP) to challenge RaST effect in the CR mice. Using a signal-amplifying cancer-imaging agent, LS301, we identified latent minimal residual disseminated tumors in the lymph nodes (LNs) of the CR group. Despite increased protumor immunogens in the CR mice, RaST prevented cancer relapse and metastasis through dynamic redistribution of ROS-regenerative TiO 2 from bones at the early treatment stage to the spleen and LNs, maintaining active immunity against cancer progression and migration. This study reveals the immune-mechanistic underpinnings of RaST-mediated antitumor immune response and highlights immunogenic reprogramming of tumors in response to RaST. Overcoming apoptosis resistance through complementary necroptosis activation paves the way for strategic drug combinations to improve cancer treatment.
109565 | Determination of the kappa anti-alpha(1,3) dextran immune response difference by A gene(s) in the VKappa-locus of mice. Mice lacking the V(alpha(1,3) (h gamma1)-gene do not produce a gamma1 anti-alpha(1,3) dextran response. However, on hyperimmunization some strains mount a kappa-anti-alpha(1,3) dextran response, whereas other remain nonresponder. Responsiveness in dominant. The kappa-anti-alpha(1,3) response difference is linked to the Ly-3 locus on chromosone 6 and is likely the result of a structural Vkappa-gene(s). In conjunction with previous work, three Vkappa-allogroups can now be distinguished. At present, this is the only example of an immune responsiveness difference associated with the Vkappa-locus.
109570 | Ef2: a new LY-3-linked light-chain marker expressed in normal mouse serum immunoglobulin. A new light-chain marker has been detected in normal mouse serum immunoglobulin light chains by gel isoelectric focusing. The marker (Ef2) involves the presence of two major and several minor bands in the normal light-chain IF profiles. Strains expressing the marker IF bands are designated Igk-Ef2a, whereas those lacking the bands are Igk-Ef2b. The majority of inbred strains are Igk-Ef2a. Strains found to be Igk-Ef2b are NZB/BlNJ, BDP/J, C58/J, I/LnJ, CE/J, and P/J. The strain distribution of the alleles differs from the distribution of alleles at the Ly-2 and Ly-3 loci, suggesting the new marker may represent a separate locus. Genetic studies have shown that Igk-Ef2 locus is closely linked to Igk-Ef1 and Hd loci on Chromosome 6, indicating that it is also closely linked to Ly-3. The relative importance of the bands controlled by the Igk-Ef2 locus suggests that the entire normal light-chain pool could be controlled by as few as 100 such loci.
1362101 | Fine-structure mapping of the complex locus Odc-rs5 relative to Igk and distal loci. Odc-rs5 was previously identified as a complex locus closely linked to the Igk complex on mouse Chromosome (Chr) 6 and comprising at least five copies of a sequence related to the mRNA encoding ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in the genomes of mice of some inbred strains and at least seven copies in others (Richards-Smith and Elliott, Mammalian Genome 2: 215, 1992). In the present study, Odc-rs5 was shown to be composed of at least seven copies of the ODC sequence in both the Odc-rs5a and Odc-rs5b haplotypes. Based upon the distribution of DNA restriction fragments (RFs) that had previously been associated with Odc-rs5a or Odc-rs5b among 42 mice of inbred laboratory strains having various haplotypes at Igk and in mice of two congenic strains [B6.PL-Ly-2a, Ly-3a(75NS)/Cy and B6.PL-Ly-2a,Ly-3a(85NS)/Cy] and a backcross-derived stock (NAK) known to be recombinant within Igk, a fine structure map of Odc-rs5 was deduced relative to Igk and more distal loci. Odc-rs5-derived RFs were located to three distinct regions within and/or distal to Igk and to a fourth site between (Ly-3, Ly-2) and Raf-1. Additionally, DNAs from 19 mice of inbred strains and random-bred stocks derived from wild progenitors trapped at various locations were analyzed and found to exhibit an unexpected variety of combinations of RFs associated with the two Odc-rs5 haplotypes most frequently observed among inbred laboratory strains of mice.
1644447 | Inducible functions in hybrids of a Lyt-2+ BW5147 transfectant and the 2C CTL line. Cytolytic activity and release of interleukin 2 (IL-2) were induced in Lyt-2-positive T-T cell hybrids by incubation with either concanavalin A or irradiated stimulator cells. Since hybrids of Lyt-2-positive class I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with the fusable mouse thymoma cell line, BW5147, are invariably Lyt-2-negative, a derivative of BW5147 was produced by transfection which constitutively expresses surface Lyt-2.1. This cell line, 3B2, was fused with the H-2Ld-specific long term CTL line, 2C. Such hybrids expressed the transfected Lyt-2 gene but not the endogenous gene of the 2C fusion partner. That Lyt-2 plays a functional role in hybrids of 3B2 with 2C is shown by the observations that: 1) cytolysis by Lyt-2-positive hybrids was inhibited by Lyt-2-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb); 2) Lyt-2-positive but not Lyt-2-negative subclones of one such line develop specific cytotoxicity when incubated with stimulator cells; 3) Less IL-2 was released from Lyt-2-negative subclones incubated with stimulator cells than from Lyt-2-positive subclones; 4) Lyt-2-specific mAb inhibits release of IL-2 from Lyt-2-positive hybrids incubated with stimulator cells. All Lyt-2-positive hybrids expressed functional surface Lyt-3 encoded by the CTL fusion partner, demonstrating that expression of the Lyt-3 gene is not sensitive to the negative regulation which shuts off the endogenous Lyt-2 gene in hybrids of class I-specific CTLs with the 3B2 or BW5147 cell lines. The existence of inducible T-T cell hybrids expressing functional Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 provides a system for evaluation of the role(s) of Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 in the induction of function independent of cell growth.
1944379 | Induction of multilocus lesions by UVC-radiation in mouse L5178Y lymphoblasts. The survival, the mutant frequency and the nature of the DNA alteration responsible for the inactivation of the thymidine kinase (tk) locus were investigated in 5 strains of mouse L5178Y lymphoblasts exposed to UVC radiation. The nature of the DNA alteration was investigated in independent TK-/- mutants using Southern blot analysis. The concomitant loss of galactokinase (GK) activity in homogenates of individual TK-/- mutants was taken as an indication that the lesion inactivating the tk allele extended to the neighboring galactokinase (gk) allele. The survival of strains LY-R16 and LY-R83 was decreased to a greater extent than that of strains LY-S1, LY-SR1, and LY-3.7.2C, reflecting a deficiency in excision repair in strains derived from LY-R cells. The TK-/- mutant frequency of strain LY-R83, which is monosomic for chromosome 11 and thus hemizygous for the tk and gk genes, was only 50% of the mutant frequency of strain LY-R16 which is heterozygous for the tk gene. Moreover, a greatly reduced percentage of individual spontaneous and UVC-induced TK-/- mutants of strain LY-R83 showed loss of GK activity in comparison to the other strains. This result indicates that UVC irradiation induces intergenic mutations and that such mutants are poorly recovered in the hemizygous strain. Strain LY-3.7.2C appears to have only one active galactokinase (gk) allele, and very few TK-/- mutants of this strain showed loss of GK activity, possibly because this strain, although heterozyogous for the tk gene, is hemizygous in the region of the gk gene. Strains LY-R16 and LY-S1 are deficient in the repair of UVC- and X-radiation-induced damage, respectively, and the percentage of TK-/- mutants with intergenic mutations was higher for strain LY-R16 after UVC-radiation and for strain LY-S1 after X-radiation. These results indicate that unrepaired DNA lesions lead to an increase in intergenic mutations.
2010217 | The genetic basis of negative selection of Tcrb-V11+ T cells. Non-H-2 genes responsible for negative selection of Tcrb-V11+ T cells were examined using backcross mice of various strains with C58, which does not delete Tcrb-V11+ T cells. Two independently segregating genes were found: one leading to partial deletion was closely linked to Ly-2/Ly-3 on chromosome 6, and the second giving virtually complete deletion has not yet been mapped. The A strain had only the former, whereas BALB/c, BALB.K, B10.BR, CBA-T6, C3H/He, and DBA/2 expressed both of these genes. Although a gene(s) of the NIH strain led only to partial deletion, the chromosomal localization of the gene(s) has not yet been determined: no informative polymorphic molecules are expressed from genes on chromosome 6 of this strain.
2359411 | The effect of temperature on the binding kinetics and equilibrium constants of monoclonal antibodies to cell surface antigens. The effect of temperature on the kinetic association and dissociation binding parameters, and equilibrium constants of four monoclonal antibodies to the murine Ly-2.1 and Ly-3.1 antigens has been studied using flow cytometry. All four monoclonal antibodies were conjugated to FITC and their association to, and dissociation from, the surface of murine thymoma cells was observed at 15 sec intervals, at temperatures between 1 and 37 degrees C. The initial association rate constant and the dissociation rate constant for each antibody at each temperature were calculated from graphs of the first-order reactions and it was demonstrated that an increase in temperature caused an increase in both association rate and dissociation rate of the antibodies. Generally the increase in association rate with temperature was less than the increase in dissociation rate. Differences between antibodies to the same antigen (Ly-2.1) suggest that changes in membrane fluidity were not solely responsible for the changes in association rate. However, the equilibrium constants (Keq) did not always show a simple relationship of increasing temperature causing decreasing values for Keq. For one antibody the highest value for Keq was seen at 17 degrees C rather than at 37 degrees C and differences in Keq between individual antibodies were greater at 1 degree C than at 37 degrees C. Kinetic rate constants are usually measured at 4 degrees C or room temperature, therefore for antibodies under consideration for in vivo use, measurements at 37 degrees C are more appropriate.
2364395 | Comparison of in vitro cell binding characteristics of four monoclonal antibodies and their individual tumor localization properties in mice. Although many antibodies are being used for imaging studies, it is not clear which in vitro properties of antibodies will best reflect their in vivo characteristics. The ability to correlate in vitro binding characteristics of monoclonal antibodies to tumor antigens with their in vivo localization characteristics, particularly with respect to tumor localization properties, is desirable for rapid selection of monoclonal antibodies with potential for clinical use. The in vitro binding characteristics of three monoclonal antibodies to the murine Ly-2.1 antigen and one to the Ly-3.1 antigen have been studied on cultured tumor cells bearing these antigens. The association and dissociation rate constants, apparent affinity, and immunoreactivity of each antibody in vitro were compared with their ability to localize the s.c. tumors from the same cell line growing in Ly-2.1-/Ly-3.1-mice. The antibody with the highest affinity and fastest association rate localized to tumor at the earliest time (16-20 h after injection) and had the highest percentage of the injected dose/g in the tumor (greater than 25%). The antibody with the lowest affinity showed significantly less localization to tumor cells, compared with the other three antibodies. The ranking of the antibodies by affinity agreed with the ranking in terms of their ability to localize to tumors, but the in vitro immunoreactivity of the antibodies, as measured by a cell binding assay, did not correlate with their tumor localization properties. Immunoscintigraphic studies did not precisely correlate with biodistribution data or in vitro binding characteristics, because tumors could be satisfactorily imaged with each antibody, although it was noted that the antibody with the highest affinity gave the best image. The results indicate that kinetic binding parameters and affinity of monoclonal antibodies may be useful in predicting their potential for tumor localization and that kinetics of association of antibodies in vitro may predict localization kinetics in vivo.
2444958 | [Immunochemical characteristics of alloantigens Lyt-1, Lyt-2 and Lyt-3]. 
2473955 | A new antigenic determinant on intra-epithelial lymphocytes and its association with CD45. Rat monoclonal antibodies were prepared against intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) isolated from the gut of Balb/c mice and screened for selective reactivity with mucosal lymphocytes. One antibody, M371, identified a new surface antigen on 30-40% of IEL. It bound to very few, if any, lymphocytes within the lamina propria and to none in other lymphoid tissues; neither did it stain lymph node lymphocytes that had been stimulated in culture with mitogens or alloantigens. The data suggest that M371 identifies a sessile population of IEL and that expression of the antigen is induced locally in the epithelium. In addition to IEL, M371 bound to some goblet cells in the mid and distal small gut but not in the proximal region. Double-staining experiments showed that M371 was highly specific for IEL with the phenotype Lyt-2+, Lyt-3-, Thy-1-, CD3+ and stained a majority of cells in this subpopulation. M371 precipitated a surface molecule approximately 275,000 MW in size, which was also precipitated by antibodies to CD45. Treatment of fixed IEL with sodium periodate prevented staining by M371, suggesting involvement of carbohydrate in the epitope. The specificity of M371 was shown to differ from that of the antibodies CT1 and CT2, which identify a carbohydrate determinant of CD45 expressed on cytotoxic lymphocytes and IEL. The possibility that the gut epithelium provides an environment for the functional differentiation of thymus-independent mucosal T cells is discussed.
2576243 | Murine Ly-3 restriction fragment length polymorphism and transcript size differences. 
2592017 | Blocking of cytotoxic T-cell function of MOLF/Ei mice by anti-Ly 35.1 monoclonal antibody. Ly 35.1 antigen is an alloantigen expressed only on T cells of Mus musculus molossinus-derived inbred strains. Previous findings indicated that the genetic locus coding for Ly 35 antigen was closely linked to Ly 2/3 on chromosome 6 and that epitopes detected by Ly 2.1 and Ly 35.1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were closely associated, as shown by binding inhibition assay. In this study, we examined the blocking effects of anti-Ly 2.1 and anti-Ly 35.1 mAb on cytotoxic T-cell function of MOLF/Ei mice generated against BALB/c. MOLF/Ei cytotoxicity was blocked by Ly 35.1 mAb, but not by anti-Ly 2.1 mAb. Additional tests showed that cytotoxicity was blocked by Ly 3.1 mAb, but not Ly 3.2 or Ly 2.2 mAb. These results suggested that MOLF/Ei mice express Ly 3.1, but not Ly 2.1 antigen at a functional level, and that Ly 35.1 may be a functional epitope of Ly 2 antigen in the MOLF/Ei strain.
3169881 | Structure and expression of the Lyt-3a gene of C.AKR mice. The mouse Lyt-3a gene, which encodes the Lyt-3.1 T-cell surface alloantigen of the C.AKR strain, has been cloned, and the nucleotide sequence of its exons and more than 2 kb of 5' flanking sequence have been determined. The gene extends over approximately 16 kb of DNA and consists of six exons encoding leader, leader plus V-like domain, membrane-proximal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. The only difference between the coding region of the Lyt-3a gene and the cDNA sequences reported for Lyt-3b (Nakauchi et al. 1987. Panaccio et al. 1987) is at position 77 of the mature protein where Lyt-3a encodes serine and Lyt-3b encodes arginine. This substitution must therefore be the basis for the serological distinction between the Lyt-3.1 and Lyt-3.2 alloantigens. Potential TATA and CAAT sequences, two Sp1 protein binding sites, two extended repeats of the dinucleotide, CA, a number of short inverted repeats, and an inverted segment of the mouse B1 repetitive sequence are found 5' to the Lyt-3a gene. Two consensus poly-A addition signals and a complete copy of the mouse B1 sequence are found 3' to the gene. Both B1-related regions are flanked by short direct repeats suggesting that they arose by an insertional mechanism. Cotransfection of the Lyt-3a gene together with a cloned Lyt-2a gene resulted in expression of both Lyt-2 and Lyt-3.1 on the surface of Ltk- and BW5147 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3266689 | [Allogeneic lymphocyte induction in vivo of highly active T-killers specific for the molecule of the H-2 class-I complex and the detection of their receptors in vitro]. The optimal conditions are found for in vivo irradiated lymphocyte induction of high cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific to the H-2Kb molecule with a subsequent monoculture differentiation. B10.D2(R101) CTL have a pronounced excess as compared to B10.A (4R) CTL, with respect to lysis intensity of the same target cells (TC), and requires a lower term of the monoculture incubation in spite of their specificity to the same H-2Kb molecule. As the susceptibility of TC for CTL lysis is higher (M phi as compared to EL-4 thymoma cells), CTL are much more inactivated with the monoclonal antibodies to Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 antigens without complement. Anti-H-2Kb CTL differentiated in the monoculture cross react to TC bearing third-party H-2 molecules (Kk, Dq, Dk). Unlike a stable CTL adherence to the donor M phi monolayer, nonspecific CTL adherence to the syngeneic M phi monolayer declines in the presence of EGTA, and as a result of repeated detachment of lymphocytes. The findings give rise to study receptor affinity expressed on the in vivo induced CTL surface, the CTL receptor monoclonal antibody and the CTL differentiation factor.
3421809 | Biological characterization of three new spontaneous mouse lymphomas and comparison with the leukemia P388. Three spontaneous lymphomas of 23- to 24-month-old (AB/Jena X DBA/2 Jena)F1 females were serially transplanted into syngeneic hosts. They were histologically classified as malignant lymphoblastic lymphomas (ABDt2 and ABDt5) and as a malignant lymphoma of histiocytic type (ABDt6). All lymphomas disseminated into the liver, spleen, and pancreas, whereas ABDt2 and ABDt5 additionally infiltrated the bone marrow and leptomeninx. None of the tumors showed a leukemic growth form, but extreme granulocytosis was observed in leukemia P388-bearing mice. Since the lymphomas ABDt2 and ABDt5 expressed T-cell differentiation antigens Ly-1, Ly-2, and Ly-3, they are thought to be of T-cell origin. On the contrary to the lymphocytes of parental mouse strain ABDt2 and ABDt5 cells reacted with anti H-2.23 allosera. All tumors have been found to be sensitive to at least 5/7 clinically used anticancer drugs. But only ABDt2- and P388-bearing mice survived longer than 60 days after treatment with the potent anticancer drug 1,4-benzoquinone-guanylhydrazone-thiosemicarbazone (ambazone). Successful chemotherapy of both tumors was accompanied with resistance of the hosts against the second transplant of the same tumor. Summarizing the characteristics of the newly established transplantation tumors it is concluded that they can be recommended as screening models in the search for new antineoplastic agents.
8069589 | Enhanced antitumour effects using a combination of two antibodies conjugated to different drugs. The heterogeneity of tumour antigen expression, the differential sensitivity of individual cells to drugs and the use drug--antibody immunoconjugates with limited potency can limit the antitumour effects of immunoconjugate therapy. In this study we have used two different antibodies linked to two different drugs Melphalan (Mel) and Idarubicin (Ida), each with a different site action, to evaluate the potential of using cocktails of immunoconjugates. A series of drug combinations were screened for their synergistic activity in vitro using the inhibition of [3H]-thyrmidine uptake by E3 cells, and constructing isobolagrams: Mel plus Ida was the only combination found to be synergistic in vitro and this synergism extended to the drugs after conjugation to antibodies. In addition, in vivo studies in mice bearing E3 tumours showed that synergy between both free drugs and between Ida-anti-Ly-2.1 and N-AcMEL-anti-Ly-3.1 immunoconjugates was time dependent, requiring treatment with Ida or Ida-MoAb conjugates prior to the addition of the second melphalan containing immunoconjugate. The use of two different antibodies, anti-Ly-2.1 and anti-Ly-3.1 against E3 (Ly-2.1+ve, Ly-3.1+ve) gave greater synergy in vitro compared to using only one antibody. Again a cocktail of two antibody immunoconjugates provided significantly greater antitumour efficacy when given to tumour bearing mice, provided that the Ida-anti-Ly-2.1 was given 24 h before injection of N-AcMEL-anti-Ly-3.1. The enhanced antitumour effect was not observed when the immunoconjugates were given simultaneously, or if the same antibody was used in each conjugate. Of importance was the finding that although the anti-tumour effect was synergistic, there was no increase in toxicity noted. The increased therapeutic index observed by using a double cocktail (2 antibodies + 2 drugs) could have major implications for immunoconjugate therapy.
8423051 | Differential susceptibility of mouse Lyt-2 and Lyt-3 genes to negative regulation. Hybrids of Lyt-2/Lyt-3-positive class I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) with the BW5147 thymoma cell line (Lyt-2/Lyt-3-negative) are known to be Lyt-2/Lyt-3-negative due to shutoff of transcription of the CTL's Lyt-2 gene. Hybrids of a constitutively Lyt-2-positive transfectant of BW5147 (3B2) with a long term CTL line, 2C, and with CTLs generated in a mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR) shut off the CTL's Lyt-2 gene as expected but express the CTL's Lyt-3 gene product as a heterodimer with the product of the transfected Lyt-2 gene. Thus the Lyt-3 gene is not subject to the same negative regulatory influences as the Lyt-2 gene. That expression of Lyt-2 is not necessary for Lyt-3 gene transcription to continue is demonstrated by the finding that hybrids of MLR-generated CTLs with either BW5147 (Lyt-2-negative) or 3B2 (Lyt-2-positive) cells express Lyt-3 RNA. Southern hybridization and structural analysis of DNA fragments generated using the polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that hybrids contain several species of Lyt-3 RNA, one of which lacks the exon encoding the extracellular V-like domain and appears to be the product of an alternatively-spliced RNA transcript.
8475118 | Locus controlling Bordetella pertussis-induced histamine sensitization (Bphs), an autoimmune disease-susceptibility gene, maps distal to T-cell receptor beta-chain gene on mouse chromosome 6. Pertussis toxin (PTX) is the primary component responsible for eliciting the majority of biological activities associated with Bordetella pertussis, including the induction of several tissue-adjuvant models of organ-specific autoimmune disease. PTX, when administered in vivo, enhances vascular permeability, which is made manifest by a concomitant increase in sensitivity to a variety of agents and treatments affecting the vascular bed. One such agent is histamine, and the response to PTX, as measured by hypersensitivity following vasoactive amine challenge, is genetically controlled by the Bphs locus. Susceptibility to the induction of both experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and experimental allergic orchitis (EAO) in mice is associated with, and in the latter case linked to, a susceptible allele at this locus. We report here the mapping of the Bphs locus to mouse chromosome 6, telomeric of Tcrb and centromeric of Prp (D6Nds8). This region also contains a number of loci of immunologic relevance including Igk, Ly-2, Ly-3, Il-5r, Ly-35, Ly-4, and Tnfr-2.
12429030 | Raloxifene- and estradiol-mediated effects on uterus, bone and B lymphocytes in mice. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is selective by having estrogen-agonistic effects on bone, vessels and blood lipids while it is antagonistic on mammary and uterine tissue. Our aim was to study the agonistic and antagonistic properties of the raloxifene analogue LY117018 (LY) on uterus, bone, B lymphopoiesis and B cell function. Oophorectomized and sham-operated animals were treated with s.c. injections of equipotent anti-osteoporotic doses of 17beta-estradiol (E2) (0.1 mg/kg) or LY (3 mg/kg) or vehicle as controls. Effects on bone mineral density (BMD) were studied using peripheral quantitative computed tomography, uterine weight was examined, B lymphopoiesis was examined using flow cytometry and B cell function in bone marrow and spleen was studied by the use of an ELISPOT assay. E2 and LY had similar effects on BMD and bone marrow B lymphopoiesis, while LY had a clear antagonistic effect on endogenous estrogen in uterine tissue and no stimulating effect on the frequency of Ig-producing B cells in sham-operated animals. Our results are discussed in the context of estrogen receptor biology, relations between the immune system and bone metabolism and also with respect to the estrogen-mediated effects on rheumatic diseases.
17963518 | Impact of imatinib on the pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy of etoposide and/or ifosfamide. BACKGROUND: Using a human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) xenografted in nude mice, we have previously reported enhanced tumor growth inhibition following chemotherapy in combination with imatinib (STI571). We therefore investigated the in vivo impact of imatinib on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of chemotherapy. METHODS: Two different human tumors were used: SCLC6 small cell lung cancer xenografted in nude mice, and LY-3 EBV-associated human B-cell lymphoma xenografted in SCID mice. Plasma, urine, and fecal concentrations of etoposide (VP16) were determined by a validated high performance liquid chromatography method. Plasma concentrations of ifosfamidewere determined by a validated gas chromatography assay with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. RESULTS: Slight tumor growth inhibition was induced by imatinib administered alone in one in vivo EBV-associated B-cell lymphomatous xenograft. In contrast, an increase of the chemotherapy-induced antitumor effect was observed in the lymphoma model but not in a small cell lung cancer model when mice bearing human xenografted tumors were treated concomitantly by imatinib and chemotherapy. This antitumor effect was not influenced by concomitant administration of fluconazole. The AUC0-3 h (Area Under the concentration-time Curve) of etoposide was increased when mice were treated with etoposide + imatinib due to decreased fecal excretion. In contrast, imatinib did not appear to influence the urinary excretion of etoposide, and concomitant administration of the CYP3A4 inhibitor, fluconazole, with imatinib did not modify the pharmacokinetics of etoposide plus imatinib alone. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these results therefore justify further prospective phase I and II clinical trials with combinations of etoposide-based chemotherapy and imatinib in patients with certain cancers, such as malignant lymphoma, with careful toxicologic monitoring.
26522985 | Crossreactive alphabeta T Cell Receptors Are the Predominant Targets of Thymocyte Negative Selection. The precise impact of thymic positive and negative selection on the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire remains controversial. Here, we used unbiased, high-throughput cloning and retroviral expression of individual pre-selection TCRs to provide a direct assessment of these processes at the clonal level in vivo. We found that 15% of random TCRs induced signaling and directed positive (7.5%) or negative (7.5%) selection, depending on strength of signal, whereas the remaining 85% failed to induce signaling or selection. Most negatively selected TCRs exhibited promiscuous crossreactivity toward multiple other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes. In contrast, TCRs that were positively selected or non-selected were minimally crossreactive. Negative selection of crossreactive TCRs led to clonal deletion but also recycling into intestinal CD4(-)CD8beta(-) intraepithelial lymphocytes (iIELs). Thus, broadly crossreactive TCRs arise at low frequency in the pre-selection repertoire but constitute the primary drivers of thymic negative selection and iIEL lineage differentiation. 
27141342 | CD8 engineered cytotoxic T cells reprogram melanoma tumor environment. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from CD8beta-deficient mice have powerful FasL-mediated cytotoxicity and IFNgamma responses, but ablated Ca2+ and NFAT signaling, which can be restored by transduction with CD8beta. Upon infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), these cells yielded GP33-specific CTL (CD8betaR) that exhibited high FasL/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity, IFNgamma CXCL9 and 10 chemokine responses. Transfer of these cells in B16-GP33 tumor bearing mice resulted in (i) massive T cell tumor infiltration, (ii) strong reduction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T cells (Treg) and IL-17-expressing T helper cells, (iii) maturation of tumor-associated antigen-presenting cells and (iv) production of endogenous, B16 melanoma-specific CTL that eradicated the tumor long after the transferred CD8betaR CTL perished. Our study demonstrates that the synergistic combination of strong Fas/FasL mediated cytotoxicity, IFNgamma and CXCL9 and 10 responses endows adoptively transferred CTL to reprogram the tumor environment and to thus enable the generation of endogenous, tumoricidal immunity.
27693350 | Loss of the HVEM Tumor Suppressor in Lymphoma and Restoration by Modified CAR-T Cells. The HVEM (TNFRSF14) receptor gene is among the most frequently mutated genes in germinal center lymphomas. We report that loss of HVEM leads to cell-autonomous activation of B cell proliferation and drives the development of GC lymphomas in vivo. HVEM-deficient lymphoma B cells also induce a tumor-supportive microenvironment marked by exacerbated lymphoid stroma activation and increased recruitment of T follicular helper (TFH) cells. These changes result from the disruption of inhibitory cell-cell interactions between the HVEM and BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator) receptors. Accordingly, administration of the HVEM ectodomain protein (solHVEM(P37-V202)) binds BTLA and restores tumor suppression. To deliver solHVEM to lymphomas in vivo, we engineered CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells that produce solHVEM locally and continuously. These modified CAR-T cells show enhanced therapeutic activity against xenografted lymphomas. Hence, the HVEM-BTLA axis opposes lymphoma development, and our study illustrates the use of CAR-T cells as \micro-pharmacies\ able to deliver an anti-cancer protein.
28289286 | Early antibody therapy can induce long-lasting immunity to SHIV. Highly potent and broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibodies (bNAbs) have been used to prevent and treat lentivirus infections in humanized mice, macaques, and humans. In immunotherapy experiments, administration of bNAbs to chronically infected animals transiently suppresses virus replication, which invariably returns to pre-treatment levels and results in progression to clinical disease. Here we show that early administration of bNAbs in a macaque simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) model is associated with very low levels of persistent viraemia, which leads to the establishment of T-cell immunity and resultant long-term infection control. Animals challenged with SHIVAD8-EO by mucosal or intravenous routes received a single 2-week course of two potent passively transferred bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-1074 (refs 13, 14)). Viraemia remained undetectable for 56-177 days, depending on bNAb half-life in vivo. Moreover, in the 13 treated monkeys, plasma virus loads subsequently declined to undetectable levels in 6 controller macaques. Four additional animals maintained their counts of T cells carrying the CD4 antigen (CD4+) and very low levels of viraemia persisted for over 2 years. The frequency of cells carrying replication-competent virus was less than 1 per 106 circulating CD4+ T cells in the six controller macaques. Infusion of a T-cell-depleting anti-CD8beta monoclonal antibody to the controller animals led to a specific decline in levels of CD8+ T cells and the rapid reappearance of plasma viraemia. In contrast, macaques treated for 15 weeks with combination anti-retroviral therapy, beginning on day 3 after infection, experienced sustained rebound plasma viraemia when treatment was interrupted. Our results show that passive immunotherapy during acute SHIV infection differs from combination anti-retroviral therapy in that it facilitates the emergence of potent CD8+ T-cell immunity able to durably suppress virus replication.
28482003 | Coenzyme Q10 reduces sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficiency in young mice. BACKGROUND: Anaesthesia can induce cognitive deficiency in young rodents and monkeys. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the anaesthesia-induced neurotoxicity and neurobehavioural deficits. We therefore assessed the effects of the mitochondrial energy enhancer coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10 ) on anaesthesia-induced cognitive deficiency in young mice to investigate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction. METHODS: Young mice ( n =134) were randomly assigned into the following four groups: control plus corn oil vehicle (60% oxygen); 3% sevoflurane [2 h daily on postnatal day (P) 6, 7, and 8] plus vehicle; CoQ 10 (50 mg kg -1 ) plus vehicle; or 3% sevoflurane plus CoQ 10 plus vehicle. We determined cognitive function using the Morris water maze at P31-P37. We quantified brain postsynaptic density protein-95, the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, adenosine triphosphate, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial membrane potential at P8 and P37. RESULTS: Coenzyme Q 10 reduced sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficiency in young mice ( F =0.90, P =0.49, n =10-16) and attenuated sevoflurane-induced reductions in postsynaptic density protein-95 ( F =10.56, P <0.01, n =6), synaptophysin ( F =8.44, P =0.01, n =6), adenosine triphosphate ( F =4.34, P =0.05, n =9), and mitochondrial membrane potential ( F =11.43, P <0.01, n =6), but not sevoflurane-induced increases in reactive oxygen species ( F =1.17, P =0.20, n =6), in brain. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CoQ 10 reduces sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficiency by mitigating sevoflurane-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, the reduction in adenosine triphosphate, and synaptic dysfunction. Coenzyme Q 10 could provide an approach to reduce the neurotoxicity of anaesthesia in the developing brain.
28530714 | CD8alphaalpha intraepithelial lymphocytes arise from two main thymic precursors. TCRalphabeta+CD4-CD8alpha+CD8beta- intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD8alphaalpha IELs) are an abundant population of thymus-derived T cells that protect the gut barrier surface. We sought to better define the thymic IEL precursor (IELp) through analysis of its maturation, localization and emigration. We defined two precursor populations among TCRbeta+CD4-CD8- thymocytes by dependence on the kinase TAK1 and rigorous lineage-exclusion criteria. Those IELp populations included a nascent PD-1+ population and a T-bet+ population that accumulated with age. Both gave rise to intestinal CD8alphaalpha IELs after adoptive transfer. The PD-1+ IELp population included more strongly self-reactive clones and was largely restricted by classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Those cells localized to the cortex and efficiently emigrated in a manner dependent on the receptor S1PR1. The T-bet+ IELp population localized to the medulla, included cells restricted by non-classical MHC molecules and expressed the receptor NK1.1, the integrin CD103 and the chemokine receptor CXCR3. The two IELp populations further differed in their use of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) alpha-chain variable region (Valpha) and beta-chain variable region (Vbeta). These data provide a foundation for understanding the biology of CD8alphaalpha IELs.
28637895 | CD4+CD8beta+ double-positive T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes respond to inflammatory signals from the skin. CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP), mature, peripheral T cells are readily detectable in a variety of species and tissues. Despite a common association with autoimmune and malignant skin disorders, however, little is understood about their role or function. Herein, we show that DP T cells are readily detectable in the blood, spleen, and peripheral lymph nodes of naive C57BL/6 mice. DP T cells were also present in Jalpha18-/- and CD1d-/- mice, indicating that these cells are not NK-T cells. After skin administration of CASAC adjuvant, but not Quil A adjuvant, both total DP T cells and skin-infiltrating DP T cells increased in number. We explored the possibility that DP T cells could represent aggregates between CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive T cells and found strong evidence that a large proportion of apparent DP T cells were indeed aggregates. However, the existence of true CD4+CD8+ DP T cells was confirmed by Amnis ImageStream (Millipore Sigma, Billerica, MA, USA) imaging. Multiple rounds of FACS sorting separated true DP cells from aggregates and indicated that conventional analyses may lead to ~10-fold overestimation of DP T cell numbers. The high degree of aggregate contamination and overestimation of DP abundance using conventional analysis techniques may explain discrepancies reported in the literature for DP T cell origin, phenotype, and function.
30297531 | Intratumoral Immunotherapy with XCL1 and sFlt3L Encoded in Recombinant Semliki Forest Virus-Derived Vectors Fosters Dendritic Cell-Mediated T-cell Cross-Priming. : Multiple lines of evidence indicate a critical role of antigen cross-presentation by conventional BATF3-dependent type 1 classical dendritic cells (cDC1) in CD8-mediated antitumor immunity. Flt3L and XCL1, respectively, constitute a key growth/differentiation factor and a potent and specific chemoattractant for cDC1. To exploit their antitumor functions in local immunotherapy, we prepared Semliki Forest Virus (SFV)-based vectors encoding XCL1 and soluble Flt3L (sFlt3L). These vectors readily conferred transgene expression to the tumor cells in culture and when engrafted as subcutaneous mouse tumor models. In syngeneic mice, intratumoral injection of SFV-XCL1-sFlt3L (SFV-XF) delayed progression of MC38- and B16-derived tumors. Therapeutic activity was observed and exerted additive effects in combination with anti-PD-1, anti-CD137, or CTLA-4 immunostimulatory mAbs. Therapeutic effects were abolished by CD8beta T-cell depletion and were enhanced by CD4 T-cell depletion, but not by T regulatory cell predepletion with anti-CD25 mAb. Antitumor effects were also abolished in BATF3- and IFNAR-deficient mice. In B16-OVA tumors, SFV-XF increased the number of infiltrating CD8 T cells, including those recognizing OVA. Consistently, following the intratumoral SFV-XF treatment courses, we observed increased BATF3-dependent cDC1 among B16-OVA tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Such an intratumoral increase was not seen in MC38-derived tumors, but both resident and migratory cDC1 were boosted in SFV-XF-treated MC38 tumor-draining lymph nodes. In conclusion, viral gene transfer of sFlt3L and XCL1 is feasible, safe, and biologically active in mice, exerting antitumor effects that can be potentiated by CD4 T-cell depletion. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that transgenic expression of sFLT3L and XCL1 in tumor cells mediates cross-priming of, and elicits potent antitumor activity from, CD8 T lymphocytes, particularly in combination with CD4 T-cell depletion.
31107909 | Sevoflurane induces cognitive impairment in young mice via autophagy. BACKGROUND: Anesthesia may induce neurotoxicity and neurocognitive impairment in young mice. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely to be determined. Meanwhile, autophagy is involved in brain development and contributes to neurodegenerative diseases. We, therefore, set out to determine the effects of sevoflurane on autophagy in the hippocampus of young mice and on cognitive function in the mice. METHODS: Six day-old mice received 3% sevoflurane, for two hours daily, on postnatal days (P) 6, 7 and 8. We then decapitated the mice and harvested the hippocampus of the young mice at P8. The level of LC3, the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I, and SQSTM1/p62 level associated with the autophagy in the hippocampus of the mice were assessed by using Western blotting. We used different groups of mice for behavioral testing via the Morris Water Maze from P31 to P37. RESULTS: The anesthetic sevoflurane increased the level of LC3-II and ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I, decreased the p62 level in the hippocampus of the young mice, and induced cognitive impairment in the mice. 3-Methyladenine, the inhibitor of autophagy, attenuated the activation of autophagy and ameliorated the cognitive impairment induced by sevoflurane in the young mice. CONCLUSION: These data showed that sevoflurane anesthesia might induce cognitive impairment in the young mice via activation of autophagy in the hippocampus of the young mice. These findings from the proof of concept studies have established a system and suggest the role of autophagy in anesthesia neurotoxicity and cognitive impairment in the young mice, pending further investigation.
31204972 | A peptide-based inhibitor of gp96 suppresses HBsAg expression and HBV replication by upregulation of p53. In hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the virus produces redundant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) that plays a key role in driving T-cell tolerance and viral persistence. However, currently available anti-HBV agents have no direct effect on HBsAg transcription and protein expression. In this study, we designed a heat shock protein gp96 inhibitor p37 with the cell penetrating peptide PTD (protein transduction domain of trans-activator of transcription), which mediated p37 internalization into hepatocytes. PTD-p37 effectively suppressed HBsAg expression and viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. We further provide evidence that PTD-p37 suppressed HBV enhancer/promoter activity via p53 upregulation. Moreover, PTD-p37 had antiviral activity against a lamivudine-resistant HBV strain. Considering that suppression of HBsAg expression is a major goal for treatment of HBV infection, our results provide a basis for developing a new therapeutic approaches targeting host factors against viral expression.
31534124 | Lung endothelial cell antigen cross-presentation to CD8+T cells drives malaria-associated lung injury. Malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) are life-threatening manifestations of severe malaria infections. The pathogenic mechanisms that lead to respiratory complications, such as vascular leakage, remain unclear. Here, we confirm that depleting CD8+T cells with anti-CD8beta antibodies in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA (PbA) prevent pulmonary vascular leakage. When we transfer activated parasite-specific CD8+T cells into PbA-infected TCRbeta-/- mice (devoid of all T-cell populations), pulmonary vascular leakage recapitulates. Additionally, we demonstrate that PbA-infected erythrocyte accumulation leads to lung endothelial cell cross-presentation of parasite antigen to CD8+T cells in an IFNgamma-dependent manner. In conclusion, pulmonary vascular damage in ALI is a consequence of IFNgamma-activated lung endothelial cells capturing, processing, and cross-presenting malaria parasite antigen to specific CD8+T cells induced during infection. The mechanistic understanding of the immunopathogenesis in malaria-associated ARDS and ALI provide the basis for development of adjunct treatments.
31548508 | Food Preservatives Induce Proteobacteria Dysbiosis in Human-Microbiota Associated Nod2-Deficient Mice. The worldwide incidence of many immune-mediated and metabolic diseases, initially affecting only the wealthy Western countries, is increasing rapidly. Many of these diseases are associated with the compositional and functional alterations of gut microbiota, i.e., dysbiosis. The most consistent markers of the dysbiosis are a decrease in microbiota diversity and an expansion of Proteobacteria. The role of food preservatives as potential triggers of gut microbiota dysbiosis has been long overlooked. Using a human microbiota-associated mouse model, we demonstrate that a mixture of common antimicrobial food additives induces dysbiosis characterised by an overgrowth of Proteobacteria phylum and a decrease in the Clostridiales order. Remarkably, human gut microbiota in a Nod2-deficient genetic background is even more susceptible to the induction of Proteobacteria dysbiosis by additives than the microbiota in a wild-type background. To conclude, our data demonstrate that antimicrobial food additives trigger gut microbiota dysbiosis in both wild-type and Nod2-deficient backgrounds and at the exposure levels reached in European populations. Whether this additive-modified gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated and metabolic diseases remains to be elucidated.
31690259 | Identification of specific B cell linear epitopes of mycoplasma hyorhinis P37 protein using monoclonal antibodies against baculovirus-expressed P37 protein. BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma hyorhinis (Mhr) is the etiologic agent of lameness and polyserositis in swine. P37 is a membrane protein of Mhr that may be an important immunogen and is a potential target for diagnostic development. However, there is little information concerning Mhr P37 protein epitopes. A precise analysis of the P37 protein epitopes should extend our understanding of the antigenic composition of the P37 protein and the humoral immune responses to Mhr infection. Investigating the epitopes of Mhr P37 will help to establish a detection method for Mhr in tissue and provide an effective tool for detecting Mhr infection. RESULTS: Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) confirmed that the expressed P37 protein was recognized by Mhr-positive porcine and mouse sera. Furthermore, the P37 protein was purified using affinity chromatography and used to immunize mice for hybridoma cell fusion. Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) found to be positive for Mhr were detected in infected lung tissue. A panel of truncated P37 proteins was used to identify the minimal B cell linear epitopes of the protein based on these mAbs. The core epitope was determined to be 206KIKKAWNDKDWNTFRNF222. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified 17 critical amino acids that determine the epitope of the P37 protein of Mhr. This study identified mAbs that could provide useful tools for investigating the Mhr P37 antigenic core epitope (amino acids 206-222) and detecting Mhr-specific antigens in infected tissue.
32106863 | Characterization of novel LncRNA P14AS as a protector of ANRIL through AUF1 binding in human cells. BACKGROUND: The CDKN2A/B locus contains crucial tumor suppressors and a lncRNA gene ANRIL. However, the mechanisms that coordinately regulate their expression levels are not clear. METHODS: Novel RNAs transcribed from the CDKN2A gene were screened by CDKN2A-specific RNA capture deep-sequencing and confirmed by Northern blotting and clone-sequencing. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) binding proteins were characterized by RNA pull-down combined with mass spectrometry and RNA immunoprecipitation. LncRNA functions in human cells were studied using a set of biological assays in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We characterized a novel lncRNA, P14AS with its promoter in the antisense strand of the fragment near CDKN2A exon 1b in human cells. The mature P14AS is a three-exon linear cytoplasmic lncRNA (1043-nt), including an AU-rich element (ARE) in exon 1. P14AS decreases AUF1-ANRIL/P16 RNA interaction and then increases ANRIL/P16 expression by competitively binding to AUF1 P37 and P40 isoforms. Interestingly, P14AS significantly promoted the proliferation of cancer cells and tumor formation in NOD-SCID mice in a P16-independent pattern. Moreover, in human colon cancer tissues, the expression levels of P14AS and ANRIL lncRNAs were significantly upregulated compared with the paired normal tissues. CONCLUSION: A novel lncRNA, P14AS, transcribed from the antisense strand of the CDKN2A/P14 gene, promotes colon cancer development by cis upregulating the expression of oncogenic ANRIL.
32423739 | Microbiota and cancer: host cellular mechanisms activated by gut microbial metabolites. In recent years, more and more data indicate the effect of human microbiota on carcinogenesis. Despite the numerous studies on the relationship between gut microbiota and carcinogenesis, the exact mechanisms of this interaction are not well studied. It becomes apparent that this relationship can be mediated by microbial metabolites. Mechanisms of some well-known bacterial genotoxins and oncogenes, such as colibactin, CagA, IpgD, VirA, P37, have been studied in detail. At the same time, a role in carcinogenesis of a large group of gut microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, polyamines, and products of polyphenol and tryptophan catabolism, is less well understood. However, more and more evidence data show the effect of bacterial metabolites on cancer development and progression. In this review, we summarize relevant data regarding the possible mechanisms that can account for the effects of gut microbial metabolites mentioned above in carcinogenesis.
33579510 | Targeted-delivery of siRNA via a polypeptide-modified liposome for the treatment of gp96 over-expressed breast cancer. Targeted gene therapy has led to significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Heat shock protein gp96 is an emerging target for tumor treatment because of its transfer ability from reticulum to tumor cell surface. CDO14 is a peptide cationic liposome developed in our laboratory with higher gene transfection efficiency and lower toxicity compared with the existing cationic liposomes. In this study, gp96-targeted liposome p37-CDO14 was constructed by modifying cationic liposome CDO14 with a gp96 inhibitor, helical polypeptide p37. Liposome p37-CDO14 could specifically bind to breast cancer cells with gp96-overexpression on the cell membrane. Both liposomes CDO14 and p37-CDO14 showed high delivery efficiency for survivin siRNA (siSuvi) to SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cells via obviously decreased survivin expression level and cell viability. P37-CDO14 significantly increased the accumulation of FAM-siRNA in tumor compared with CDO14. SiSuvi transfected by CDO14 and p37-CDO14 could inhibit the growth of xenograft in mice and the expression of survivin in tumor tissues. The anti-tumor effect of siSuvi delivered by p37-CDO14 was much higher than that delivered by CDO14. This suggests that targeted liposome p37-CDO14 is a potential gene vector for the therapy of gp96 overexpressed breast cancer.
33862170 | Early postnatal allergic airway inflammation induces dystrophic microglia leading to excitatory postsynaptic surplus and autism-like behavior. Microglia play key roles in synaptic pruning, which primarily occurs from the postnatal period to adolescence. Synaptic pruning is essential for normal brain development and its impairment is implicated in neuropsychiatric developmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recent epidemiological surveys reported a strong link between ASD and atopic/allergic diseases. However, few studies have experimentally investigated the relationship between allergy and ASD-like manifestations, particularly in the early postnatal period, when allergic disorders occur frequently. Therefore, we aimed to characterize how allergic inflammation in the early postnatal period influences microglia and behavior using mouse models of short- and long-term airway allergy. Male mice were immunized by an intraperitoneal injection of aluminum hydroxide and ovalbumin (OVA) or phosphate-buffered saline (control) on postnatal days (P) 3, 7, and 11, followed by intranasal challenge with OVA or phosphate-buffered saline solution twice a week until P30 or P70. In the hippocampus, Iba-1-positive areas, the size of Iba-1-positive microglial cell bodies, and the ramification index of microglia by Sholl analysis were significantly smaller in the OVA group than in the control group on P30 and P70, although Iba-1-positive microglia numbers did not differ significantly between the two groups. In Iba-1-positive cells, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95)-occupied areas and CD68-occupied areas were significantly decreased on P30 and P70, respectively, in the OVA group compared with the control group. Immunoblotting using hippocampal tissues demonstrated that amounts of PSD95, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor 2, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B were significantly increased in the OVA group compared with the control group on P70, and a similar increasing trend for PSD95 was observed on P30. Neurogenesis was not significantly different between the two groups on P30 or P70 by doublecortin immunohistochemistry. The social preference index was significantly lower in the three chamber test and the number of buried marbles was significantly higher in the OVA group than in the control group on P70 but not on P30, whereas locomotion and anxiety were not different between the two groups. Compared with the control group, serum basal corticosterone levels were significantly elevated and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) amounts and nuclear GR translocation in microglia, but not in neurons or astrocytes, were significantly decreased in the OVA group on P70 but not on P30. Gene set enrichment analysis of isolated microglia revealed that genes related to immune responses including Toll-like receptor signaling and chemokine signaling pathways, senescence, and glucocorticoid signaling were significantly upregulated in the OVA group compared with the control group on P30 and P70. These findings suggest that early postnatal allergic airway inflammation induces dystrophic microglia that exhibit defective synaptic pruning upon short- and long-term allergen exposure. Furthermore, long-term allergen exposure induced excitatory postsynaptic surplus and ASD-like behavior. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis activation and the compensatory downregulation of microglial GR during long-term allergic airway inflammation may also facilitate these changes.
34592334 | Growth and behavioral differences in a C57BL/6J mouse model of prenatal alcohol exposure. BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can produce behavioral deficits in the presence or absence of growth and morphological deficits. Here, we describe a murine PAE model having parallels to the clinical diagnosis of alcohol-related neurodevelopmental deficit (ARND). METHODS: Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were gavaged with alcohol (ALC, 3 g/kg) or maltodextrin daily on embryonic days (E) E8.5 through E17.5. Blood alcohol levels were 211 +- 14 mg/dL at 30 min post-gavage. Offspring behavior was tested at adolescence. RESULTS: ALC dams gained less weight during the alcohol exposure period (p = 0.035). ALC male and female pups weighed more than controls at P15 (p <= 0.001) and P22 (p <= 0.001), but not at P37, perhaps because their dams were pair-housed. During the training session for accelerating rotarod, control offspring trended to stay longer on the rotarod than did ALC offspring [F(1,54) = 2.892, p = 0.095]. In the Y-maze, ALC offspring had a higher percent alternation than did controls [F(1,54) = 16.577, p < 0.001], but activity level did not appear to differ. In the fear-conditioning test, there was no ALC effect in the training trial. In the contextual test, there was a group x minute effect for males [F(4,120) = 2.94, p = 0.023], and ALC trended to freeze less than controls in minute 1 (p = 0.076) and froze less in minute 2 (p = 0.02). In the cue test, there was a trend for a group-sex interaction [F(1,53) = 3.008, p = 0.089] on overall freezing, such that ALC males (p < 0.05) again froze less than control males, whereas ALC females (p < 0.05) froze more than control females. CONCLUSIONS: This mouse model of PAE, using a repeated intermediate exposure, produces modest behavioral impairments that are consistent along the continuum of PAE models, including deficits in associative memory and hyper-responsivity. The lack of growth or morphological deficits suggests these mice may model aspects of ARND.
34625521 | Human Cytomegalovirus Infection Promotes Expansion of a Functionally Superior Cytoplasmic CD3+ NK Cell Subset with a Bcl11b-Regulated T Cell Signature. Human CMV (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that indelibly shapes the NK cell repertoire. Using transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic approaches to evaluate peripheral blood NK cells from healthy human volunteers, we find that prior HCMV infection promotes NK cells with a T cell-like gene profile, including the canonical markers CD3epsilon, CD5, and CD8beta, as well as the T cell lineage-commitment transcription factor Bcl11b. Although Bcl11b expression is upregulated during NK maturation from CD56bright to CD56dim, we find a Bcl11b-mediated signature at the protein level for FcepsilonRIgamma, PLZF, IL-2Rbeta, CD3gamma, CD3delta, and CD3epsilon in later-stage, HCMV-induced NK cells. BCL11B is targeted by Notch signaling in T cell development, and culture of NK cells with Notch ligand increases cytoplasmic CD3epsilon expression. The Bcl11b-mediated gain of CD3epsilon, physically associated with CD16 signaling molecules Lck and CD247 in NK cells is correlated with increased Ab-dependent effector function, including against HCMV-infected cells, identifying a potential mechanism for their prevalence in HCMV-infected individuals and their prospective clinical use in Ab-based therapies.
34914943 | Loss of Sucrase-Isomaltase Function Increases Acetate Levels and Improves Metabolic Health in Greenlandic Cohorts. BACKGROUND & AIMS: The sucrase-isomaltase (SI) c.273_274delAG loss-of-function variant is common in Arctic populations and causes congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, which is an inability to break down and absorb sucrose and isomaltose. Children with this condition experience gastrointestinal symptoms when dietary sucrose is introduced. We aimed to describe the health of adults with sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. METHODS: The association between c.273_274delAG and phenotypes related to metabolic health was assessed in 2 cohorts of Greenlandic adults (n = 4922 and n = 1629). A sucrase-isomaltase knockout (Sis-KO) mouse model was used to further elucidate the findings. RESULTS: Homozygous carriers of the variant had a markedly healthier metabolic profile than the remaining population, including lower body mass index (beta [standard error], -2.0 [0.5] kg/m2; P = 3.1 x 10-5), body weight (-4.8 [1.4] kg; P = 5.1 x 10-4), fat percentage (-3.3% [1.0%]; P = 3.7 x 10-4), fasting triglyceride (-0.27 [0.07] mmol/L; P = 2.3 x 10-6), and remnant cholesterol (-0.11 [0.03] mmol/L; P = 4.2 x 10-5). Further analyses suggested that this was likely mediated partly by higher circulating levels of acetate observed in homozygous carriers (beta [standard error], 0.056 [0.002] mmol/L; P = 2.1 x 10-26), and partly by reduced sucrose uptake, but not lower caloric intake. These findings were verified in Sis-KO mice, which, compared with wild-type mice, were leaner on a sucrose-containing diet, despite similar caloric intake, had significantly higher plasma acetate levels in response to a sucrose gavage, and had lower plasma glucose level in response to a sucrose-tolerance test. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that sucrase-isomaltase constitutes a promising drug target for improvement of metabolic health, and that the health benefits are mediated by reduced dietary sucrose uptake and possibly also by higher levels of circulating acetate.
35615248 | Expression and Immunogenicity of Recombinant African Swine Fever Virus Proteins Using the Semliki Forest Virus. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large DNA virus belonging to the Asfarviridae family that damages the immune system of pigs, resulting in the death or slaughter of millions of animals worldwide. Recent modern techniques in ASFV vaccination have highlighted the potential of viral replicon particles (RPs), which can efficiently express foreign proteins and induce robust cellular and humoral immune responses compared with the existing vaccines. In this study, we established a Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vector by producing replication-defective viral particles. This vector was used to deliver RPs expressing ASFV antigens. SFV-RPs expressing ASFV p32 (SFV-p32) and p54 (SFV-p54) were tested in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. Proteins expression was evaluated via western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence, while immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The resulting RPs exhibited high levels of protein expression and elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses.
35628609 | Altered Blood and Brain Expression of Inflammation and Redox Genes in Alzheimer's Disease, Common to APPV717I x TAUP301L Mice and Patients. Despite intensive research, the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still not fully understood, and currently there are no effective treatments. Therefore, there is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers and animal models of AD to develop innovative therapeutic strategies addressing early pathologic events such as neuroinflammation and redox disturbances. The study aims to identify inflammatory and redox dysregulations in the context of AD-specific neuronal cell death and DNA damage, using the APPV717Ix TAUP301L (AT) mouse model of AD. The expression of 84 inflammatory and 84 redox genes in the hippocampus and peripheral blood of double transgenic AT mice was evaluated against age-matched controls. A distinctive gene expression profile in the hippocampus and the blood of AT mice was identified, addressing DNA damage, apoptosis and thrombosis, complemented by inflammatory factors and receptors, along with ROS producers and antioxidants. Gene expression dysregulations that are common to AT mice and AD patients guided the final selection of candidate biomarkers. The identified inflammation and redox genes, common to AD patients and AT mice, might be valuable candidate biomarkers for preclinical drug development that could be readily translated to clinical trials.
35758051 | IL-17A deletion reduces sevoflurane-induced neurocognitive impairment in neonatal mice by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway. We investigated the role of IL-17A in sevoflurane-inducedneurocognitive impairment in neonatal mice. Seventy-two wild-type (WT) and 42 IL-17A knockout (KO) neonatal mice were randomly divided into WT (n = 36), IL-17A-/- (n = 6), sevoflurane (Sev, n = 36), and IL-17A-/- + sevoflurane (IL-17A-/- + Sev, n = 36) groups. The latter two groups were given 3% sevoflurane for 2 h per day on postnatal days (P) 6-8. Behavioral experiments were performed on P30-36. At P37, RNA sequencing and qRT-PCR of the hippocampus was performed, neurons were detected by Nissl staining, and neuropathological changes were evaluated by HE staining. NF-kappaB pathway-related proteins were evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses, IL-1beta and IL-6 levels were assessed by ELISA. RNA sequencing identified 131 differentially expressed genes, highlighting several enriched biological processes (chemokine activity, immune response, extracellular region, extracellular space, inflammatory response) and signaling pathways (IL-17 signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, ECM-receptor interaction and influenza A). Repeated sevoflurane exposures induced long-term cognitive impairment in WT mice. The cognitive impairment was comparatively less severe in IL-17A KO mice. In addition, the increased levels of NF-kappaB p65, iNOS, COX-2, IL-17A, IL-6 and IL-1beta, reduced neuronal numbers and neuropathological changes were ameliorated in neonatal mice in the IL-17A-/- + Sev group compared with neonatal mice in Sev group. IL-17A deletion protects against long-term cognitive impairment induced by repeated sevoflurane exposure in neonatal mice. The underlying mechanism may relate to inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling pathway as well as the reducing neuroinflammation.
