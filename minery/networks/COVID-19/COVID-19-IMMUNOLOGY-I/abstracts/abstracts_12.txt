11074253 | Unique epitopes in RNA helicase II/Gu protein recognized by serum from a watermelon stomach patient. RNA helicase II/Gu (RH II/Gu) is a nucleolar antigen originally identified using an autoimmune serum from a patient with watermelon stomach. A later report showed that anti-RH II/Gu autoantibodies were also present at low frequency in connective tissue disease (CTD) patients who did not show any symptoms suggestive of a watermelon stomach lesion. In an attempt to understand the relationship between watermelon stomach, also called gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), and autoimmune disorder, we identified the antigenic sites recognized by these autoantibodies. Serum Gu uniquely recognized epitopes at amino acids 646-748 of RH II/Gu and all four CTD patient sera recognized antigenic sites within amino acids 1-173. Anti-RH II/Gu serum produced by immunizing rabbit with recombinant human RH II/Gu protein bound to the same antigenic sites recognized by the CTD patient sera, but it did not recognize the serum Gu epitopes. Results are also presented showing the use of these anti-RH II/Gu antibodies in the analysis of the evolutionary conservation of RH II/Gu in human, monkey and mouse.
11891046 | Genomic structure of newly identified paralogue of RNA helicase II/Gu: detection of pseudogenes and multiple alternatively spliced mRNAs. RNA helicase II/Gu (RH-II/Gu or DDX21) is a DEAD-box enzyme that localizes to the nucleoli and may be involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis or processing. It has two paralogues, RH-II/Gualpha and RH-II/Gubeta, both genes of which are on chromosome 10. Their similar genomic structures suggest the two genes arose by gene duplication. Both genes are expressed at higher levels in some normal human tissues compared to matching tumor tissues. Pseudogenes for RH-II/Gubeta exist on chromosomes 2, 3 and 4. No pseudogene was identified for RH-II/Gualpha. Both exon inclusion and exon skipping were found to post-transcriptionally regulate RH-II/Gubeta gene expression. No alternative splicing was identified for RH-II/Gualpha. Overall, the results suggest that the two paralogues of RH-II/Gu arose by gene duplication but the resulting genes are differentially regulated.
11953317 | Interferon-gamma-induced chromatin remodeling at the CIITA locus is BRG1 dependent. SWI/SNF regulates growth control, differentiation and tumor suppression, yet few direct targets of this chromatin-remodeling complex have been identified in mammalian cells. We report that SWI/SNF is required for interferon (IFN)-gamma induction of CIITA, the master regulator of major histocompatibility complex class II expression. Despite the presence of functional STAT1, IRF-1 and USF-1, activators implicated in CIITA expression, IFN-gamma did not induce CIITA in cells lacking BRG1 and hBRM, the ATPase subunits of SWI/SNF. Reconstitution with BRG1, but not an ATPase-deficient version of this protein (K798R), rescued CIITA induction, and enhanced the rate of induction of the IFN-gamma-responsive GBP-1 gene. Not ably, BRG1 inhibited the CIITA promoter in transient transfection assays, underscoring the importance of an appropriate chromosomal environment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that BRG1 interacts directly with the endogenous CIITA promoter in an IFN-gamma-inducible fashion, while in vivo DNase I footprinting and restriction enzyme accessibility assays showed that chromatin remodeling at this locus requires functional BRG1. These data provide the first link between a cytokine pathway and SWI/SNF, and suggest a novel role for this chromatin-remodeling complex in immune surveillance.
14990991 | Loss of the INI1 tumor suppressor does not impair the expression of multiple BRG1-dependent genes or the assembly of SWI/SNF enzymes. The INI1/hSNF5 tumor suppressor is an integral component of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes that contain SNF2 family ATPases BRM (Brahma) or BRG1 (Brahma Related Gene 1) and that contribute to the regulation of many genes. Genetic studies of yeast SWI/SNF enzyme revealed similar phenotypes when single or multiple components of the enzyme were deleted, indicating a requirement for each subunit. To address the contribution of INI1 in the regulation of SWI/SNF-dependent genes in mammalian cells, we examined the expression of multiple BRG1-dependent, constitutively expressed genes in INI1-deficient cancer cell lines. At least one INI1-deficient line expressed each gene, and reintroduction of INI1 had negligible effects on expression levels. Lack of INI1 also did not prevent interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-mediated induction of CIITA, which is BRG1 dependent, and GBP-1, which is BRG1 enhanced, and reintroduction of INI1 had minimal effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that BRG1 inducibly binds to the CIITA promoter despite the absence of INI1. Unlike yeast deleted for the INI1 homologue, SWI/SNF enzymes in INI1-deficient cells were largely intact. Thus in human cells, SWI/SNF enzyme complex formation and the expression of many BRG1-dependent genes are independent of INI1.
15297606 | Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT1-dependent genes by RET/PTC (rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma) oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Chimeric RET/PTC (rearranged in transformation/papillary thyroid carcinoma) oncoproteins are constitutively active tyrosine kinases found in thyroid papillary carcinoma and nonneoplastic Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although several proteins have been identified to be substrates of RET/PTC kinases, the pathogenic roles played by RET/PTC in malignant and benign thyroid diseases and the molecular mechanisms that are involved are not fully understood. We found that RET/PTC expression phosphorylates the Y701 residue of STAT1, a type II interferon (IFN)-responsive protein. RET/PTC-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation requires RET/PTC kinase activity to be intact but other tyrosine kinases, such as Janus kinases or c-Src, are not involved. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 transcriptional activation was not inhibited by suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 or -3, or protein inhibitors of activated STAT3 [(protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS3)], but PIAS1 strongly repressed the RET/PTC-induced transcriptional activity of STAT1. RET/PTC-induced STAT1 activation caused IFN regulatory factor-1 expression. We found that STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor-1 cooperated to significantly increase transcription from type IV IFN-gamma responsive promoters of class II transactivator genes. Significantly, cells stably expressing RET/PTC expressed class II transactivator and showed enhanced de novo membrane expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins. Furthermore, RET/PTC1-bearing papillary thyroid carcinoma cells strongly expressed MHC class II (human leukocyte-associated antigen-DR alpha) genes, whereas the surrounding normal tissues did not. Thus, RET/PTC is able to phosphorylate and activate STAT1. This may lead to enhanced MHC class II expression, which may explain why the tissues surrounding RET/PTC-positive cancers are infiltrated with lymphocytes. Such immune response-promoting activity of RET/PTC may also relate to the development of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
16631260 | Microarray analysis of IFN-gamma response genes in astrocytes. IFN-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been shown to activate astrocytes to acquire immune functions. In this study the effect of IFN-gamma on murine astrocytes was investigated via microarray analysis. The activating effect of IFN-gamma on the astrocyte transcriptome showed predominance toward pathways involved in adaptive immunity, initiation of the immune response and innate immunity. Previously unknown astrocytic genes expressed included members of the p47 GTPases and guanine nucleotide binding protein (GBP) families. Down-regulatory effects of IFN-gamma stimulation were confined to pathways involved in growth regulation, cell differentiation and cell adhesion. This data supports the notion that astrocytes are an important immunocompetant cell in the brain and indicate that astrocytes may have a significant role in various infectious diseases such as Toxoplasmic Encephalitis and neurological diseases with an immunological component such as Alzheimer's and autoimmune disorders.
16881865 | Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium inhibit IFN- gamma -induced gene expression by TLR2-dependent and independent pathways. Mycobacteria-infected macrophages are poor responders to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), resulting in decreased expression of IFN-gamma-induced genes. In the present study, we examined the inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced gene expression by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and four different Mycobacterium avium strains in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. Gamma-irradiated M. tuberculosis inhibited mRNA expression of a panel of six different IFN- gamma-induced genes. All four of the M. avium strains completely inhibited IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC class II Aalpha and Ebeta mRNA. However, the Mac101 strain, which is serovar 1, inhibited IFN-gamma induction of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and guanylate-binding protein-1 (GBP-1) mRNA to a greater extent than the other M. avium strains, which are serovar 2. In this study, we also show that mycobacteria inhibit gene expression by both toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent and independent pathways. The inhibition of IFN-gamma-induced gene expression by M. avium was reduced but not completely blocked in macrophages from TLR2(/) mice. IFN-gamma-induced gene expression was also inhibited by mycobacteria in RAW264.7 cells expressing dominantnegative TLR2 or myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), further indicating the existence of a pathway independent of TLR2 and MyD88. These data suggest that mycobacteria inhibit IFN-gamma-induced gene expression by multiple pathways involving both TLR2 and non-TLR receptors.
17696781 | Sumoylation of the zinc finger protein ZXDC enhances the function of its transcriptional activation domain. The transcription of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes is dependent on the co-activator protein class II trans-activator (CIITA). We have recently identified a protein known as zinc finger X-linked duplicated family member C (ZXDC) that, along with its binding partner ZXDA, forms a complex that interacts with CIITA and regulates MHC II transcription. Western blot analysis with anti-ZXDC antibodies identified two species of the ZXDC protein, one migrating near its predicted molecular mass and one with slower electrophoretic mobility. We report here that the slower migrating form is the result of sumoylation at a single lysine residue within the transcriptional activation domain of ZXDC. Three SUMO proteins (SUMO-1, -2 and -3) can modify the ZXDC protein. Multiple SUMO E3 ligase enzymes and HDAC4 can facilitate ZXDC sumoylation, and one ligase, PIASy, interacts with a specific region of the ZXDC protein. We found that sumoylation does not appear to disrupt or modulate the interaction of ZXDC with its binding partners. Rather, sumoylation of ZXDC is required for full activity of the transcriptional activation domain. Our findings suggest that sumoylation is an important regulator of ZXDC.
18466972 | Innate immunomodulation with recombinant interferon-alpha enhances resistance of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. We examined the in vivo immunostimulatory effects of a recombinant Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) interferon-alpha2 (rSasaIFN-alpha2). The mature rSasaIFN-alpha2, expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, was administered to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) via the oral, immersion, or intraperitoneal (IP) injection route. Injection of rSasaIFN-alpha2 at 0.1microg/g fish gave significantly greater protection than a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injection against a lethal challenge of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), with a relative percent survival of 39%. Relative percent survival (RPS) increased significantly to 92% when the fish were injected with rSasaIFN-alpha2 at 1microg/g fish. Antiviral protection was evident for up to 7 days post-injection of rSasaIFN-alpha2. Administration of rSasaIFN-alpha2 by the oral or immersion route was not protective, and the fish succumbed to virus infection. The level of systemic IFN-induced expression of the Mx1 gene was significantly greater (p<0.01) in the IFN-injected group than in the PBS-injected group, and this was correlated with the fish survival rates in the challenge study. We used relative quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions to examine the systemic expression of several other IFN-induced genes (including genes for IFN1, IFN regulatory factors 1 and 2, MHC-I, STAT1, vig-1, and GBP) and found that their expression was significantly increased 1-day post-rSasaIFN-alpha2 injection. Expression of the IFN-gamma and interleukin-1beta genes was not significantly increased. Thus, a salmonid rIFN-alpha can modulate the innate immune response of rainbow trout and mediate early antiviral protection against IHNV.
18566411 | Activation of the JAK/STAT-1 signaling pathway by IFN-gamma can down-regulate functional expression of the MHC class I-related neonatal Fc receptor for IgG. Expression of many MHC genes is enhanced at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level following exposure to the cytokine IFN-gamma. However, in this study we found that IFN-gamma down-regulated the constitutive expression of the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), an MHC class I-related molecule that functions to transport maternal IgG and protect IgG and albumin from degradation. Epithelial cell, macrophage-like THP-1 cell, and freshly isolated human PBMC exposure to IFN-gamma resulted in a significant decrease of FcRn expression as assessed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. The down-regulation of FcRn was not caused by apoptosis or the instability of FcRn mRNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel mobility shift assays showed that STAT-1 bound to an IFN-gamma activation site in the human FcRn promoter region. Luciferase expression from an FcRn promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was not altered in JAK1- and STAT-1-deficient cells following exposure to IFN-gamma, whereas expression of JAK1 or STAT-1 protein restored the IFN-gamma inhibitory effect on luciferase activity. The repressive effect of IFN-gamma on the FcRn promoter was selectively reversed or blocked by mutations of the core nucleotides in the IFN-gamma activation site sequence and by overexpression of the STAT-1 inhibitor PIAS1 or the dominant negative phospho-STAT-1 mutations at Tyr-701 and/or Ser-727 residues. Furthermore, STAT-1 might down-regulate FcRn transcription through sequestering the transcriptional coactivator CREB binding protein/p300. Functionally, IFN-gamma stimulation dampened bidirectional transport of IgG across a polarized Calu-3 lung epithelial monolayer. Taken together, our results indicate that the JAK/STAT-1 signaling pathway was necessary and sufficient to mediate the down-regulation of FcRn gene expression by IFN-gamma.
21731497 | Interferon regulatory factor 8 regulates pathways for antigen presentation in myeloid cells and during tuberculosis. IRF8 (Interferon Regulatory Factor 8) plays an important role in defenses against intracellular pathogens, including several aspects of myeloid cells function. It is required for ontogeny and maturation of macrophages and dendritic cells, for activation of anti-microbial defenses, and for production of the Th1-polarizing cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) in response to interferon gamma (IFNgamma) and protection against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The transcriptional programs and cellular pathways that are regulated by IRF8 in response to IFNgamma and that are important for defenses against M. tuberculosis are poorly understood. These were investigated by transcript profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation on microarrays (ChIP-chip). Studies in primary macrophages identified 368 genes that are regulated by IRF8 in response to IFNgamma/CpG and that behave as stably segregating expression signatures (eQTLs) in F2 mice fixed for a wild-type or mutant allele at IRF8. A total of 319 IRF8 binding sites were identified on promoters genome-wide (ChIP-chip) in macrophages treated with IFNgamma/CpG, defining a functional G/AGAAnTGAAA motif. An analysis of the genes bearing a functional IRF8 binding site, and showing regulation by IFNgamma/CpG in macrophages and/or in M. tuberculosis-infected lungs, revealed a striking enrichment for the pathways of antigen processing and presentation, including multiple structural and enzymatic components of the Class I and Class II MHC (major histocompatibility complex) antigen presentation machinery. Also significantly enriched as IRF8 targets are the group of endomembrane- and phagosome-associated small GTPases of the IRG (immunity-related GTPases) and GBP (guanylate binding proteins) families. These results identify IRF8 as a key regulator of early response pathways in myeloid cells, including phagosome maturation, antigen processing, and antigen presentation by myeloid cells.
23225974 | Cloning, sequencing, and in silico characterization of Omp 28 of Salmonella Typhi (strain MTCC 733) to develop r-DNA vaccine for typhoid fever. BACKGROUND: Typhoid is one of the most important diseases of human beings caused by Salmonella Typhi. There are many vaccine reported against Salmonella Typhi, but search for new candidate vaccine antigens is still going on because presently available vaccines have several limitations such as short-term immunity, high cost, and allergic reaction. Several approaches such as subunit vaccines, Vi polysaccharide, mutant vaccines, and r-DNA vaccines have been tested. r- DNA vaccines have shown some promising potential (targeted Omp). Omp 28 had shown very promising results and suggests that it should be used in further studies of animal protection against the disease. OBJECTIVE: Cloning, Sequencing and In silico analysis of Omp 28 gene to develop r-DNA vaccine of S. Typhi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Omp 28 is made up of three identical subunits of 9.6 kDa showing PCR amplicon of 330 bp which has been cloned in the pJET vector. Recombinant clones has been sequenced, and data submitted to NCBI. Secondary structure was deduced by the Chou Fasman and Garnier method. The sequence of Omp 28 was studied for antigenic indexing, epitope mapping, and MHC mapping using various bioinformatics tool. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The sequence of Omp 28 has been assigned accession no GQ 907044.1 by NCBI. Secondary structure has shown it has more alpha region. Hydrophobic plot and surface probability plot shows most amino acids are surface exposed which is a requirement to develop a r-DNA vaccine. Antigenic sites are located within surface exposed regions and eight antigenic determinants are present in Omp 28. On Prosite analysis of Protein shown two motifs i.e. anaphylatoxin domain signature motif at position 219-252 and other one was iron sulphur binding region signature motif at position 36-44. On epitope analysis total six major B cell epitopes were observed which can provoke humoral immunity. On T cell epitope mapping several major epitopes has been found in case of MHC class I and MHC class II. It indicates that Omp 28 can provoke cell mediated as well as humoral immunity and can be proven a promising candidates of Salmonella Typhi.
26673782 | Smooth Muscle-Like Cells Generated from Human Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Display Marker Gene Expression and Electrophysiological Competence Comparable to Bladder Smooth Muscle Cells. The use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiated toward a smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype may provide an alternative for investigators interested in regenerating urinary tract organs such as the bladder where autologous smooth muscle cells cannot be used or are unavailable. In this study we measured the effects of good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant expansion followed by myogenic differentiation of human MSCs on the expression of a range of contractile (from early to late) myogenic markers in relation to the electrophysiological parameters to assess the functional role of the differentiated MSCs and found that differentiation of MSCs associated with electrophysiological competence comparable to bladder SMCs. Within 1-2 weeks of myogenic differentiation, differentiating MSCs significantly expressed alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA; ACTA2), transgelin (TAGLN), calponin (CNN1), and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC; MYH11) according to qRT-PCR and/or immunofluorescence and Western blot. Voltage-gated Na+ current levels also increased within the same time period following myogenic differentiation. In contrast to undifferentiated MSCs, differentiated MSCs and bladder SMCs exhibited elevated cytosolic Ca2+ transients in response to K+-induced depolarization and contracted in response to K+ indicating functional maturation of differentiated MSCs. Depolarization was suppressed by Cd2+, an inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+-channels. The expression of Na+-channels was pharmacologically identified as the Nav1.4 subtype, while the K+ and Ca2+ ion channels were identified by gene expression of KCNMA1, CACNA1C and CACNA1H which encode for the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel BKCa channels, Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channels and Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels, respectively. This protocol may be used to differentiate adult MSCs into smooth muscle-like cells with an intermediate-to-late SMC contractile phenotype exhibiting voltage-gated ion channel activity comparable to bladder SMCs which may be important for urological regenerative medicine applications. 
26844425 | B Cell-Activating Transcription Factor Plays a Critical Role in the Pathogenesis of Anti-Major Histocompatibility Complex-Induced Obliterative Airway Disease. Antibodies (Abs) against major histocompatibility complex (MHC) results in T helper-17 (Th17)-mediated immunity against lung self-antigens (SAgs), K-alpha1 tubulin and collagen V and obliterative airway disease (OAD). Because B cell-activating transcription factor (BATF) controls Th17 and autoimmunity, we proposed that BATF may play a critical role in OAD. Anti-H2K(b) was administered intrabronchially into Batf (-/-) and C57BL/6 mice. Histopathology of the lungs on days 30 and 45 after Ab administration to Batf (-/-) mice resulted in decreased cellular infiltration, epithelial metaplasia, fibrosis, and obstruction. There was lack of Abs to SAgs, reduction of Sag-specific interleukin (IL)-17 T cells, IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-1beta, fibroblast growth factor-6, and CXCL12 and decreased Janus kinase 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and retinoid-related orphan receptor gammaT. Further, micro-RNA (miR)-301a, a regulator of Th17, was reduced in Batf (-/-) mice in contrast to upregulation of miR-301a and downregulation of protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) in anti-MHC-induced OAD animals. We also demonstrate an increase in miR-301a in the bronchoalveolar lavage cells from lung transplant recipients with Abs to human leukocyte antigen. This was accompanied by reduction in PIAS3 mRNA. Therefore, we conclude that BATF plays a critical role in the immune responses to SAgs and pathogenesis of anti-MHC-induced rejection. Targeting BATF should be considered for preventing chronic rejection after human lung transplantation. 
27021246 | Coxiella burnetii Infects Primary Bovine Macrophages and Limits Their Host Cell Response. Although domestic ruminants have long been recognized as the main source of human Q fever, little is known about the lifestyle that the obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Coxiella burnetii adopts in its animal host. Because macrophages are considered natural target cells of the pathogen, we established primary bovine monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) as an in vitro infection model to study reservoir host-pathogen interactions at the cellular level. In addition, bovine alveolar macrophages were included to take cell type peculiarities at a host entry site into account. Cell cultures were inoculated with the virulent strain Nine Mile I (NMI; phase I) or the avirulent strain Nine Mile II (NMII; phase II). Macrophages from both sources internalized NMI and NMII. MDM were particularly permissive for NMI internalization, but NMI and NMII replicated with similar kinetics in these cells. MDM responded to inoculation with a general upregulation of Th1-related cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) early on (3 h postinfection). However, inflammatory responses rapidly declined when C. burnetii replication started. C. burnetii infection inhibited translation and release of IL-1beta and vastly failed to stimulate increased expression of activation markers, such as CD40, CD80, CD86, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Such capability of limiting proinflammatory responses may help Coxiella to protect itself from clearance by the host immune system. The findings provide the first detailed insight into C. burnetii-macrophage interactions in ruminants and may serve as a basis for assessing the virulence and the host adaptation of C. burnetii strains.
28238108 | Enhanced vascular biocompatibility of decellularized xeno-/allogeneic matrices in a rodent model. Glutaraldehyde preservation is the gold standard for cardiovascular biological prosthesis. However, secondary calcifications and the absence of tissue growth remain major limitations. Our study assessed in vitro and in vivo the biocompatibility of human (fascia lata, pericardium) and porcine tissues (pericardium, peritoneum) treated with a physicochemical procedure for decellularization and non-conventional pathogens inactivation. Biopsies were performed before and after treatment to assess decellularization (HE/Dapi staining/DNA quantification/MHC I/alpha gal immunostaining) and mechanical integrity. Forty-five rats received an abdominal aortic patch of native cryopreserved tissues (n = 20), treated tissues (n = 20) or glutaraldehyde-preserved bovine pericardium (GBP, control, n = 5). Grafts were explanted at 4 weeks and processed for HE/von Kossa staining and immunohistochemistries for lymphocytes (CD3)/macrophages (CD68) histomorphometry. 95% of decellularization was obtained for all tissues except for fascia lata (75%). Mechanical properties were slightly altered. In the in vivo model, a significant increase of CD3 and CD68 infiltrations was found in native and control implants in comparison with decellularized tissues (p < 0.05). Calcifications were found in 3 controls. Decellularized tissues were recolonized. GBP showed the most inflammatory response. This physicochemical treatment improves the biocompatibility of selected xeno/allogeneic tissues in comparison with their respective native cryopreserved tissues and with GBP. Incomplete decellularization is associated with a significantly higher inflammatory response. Our treatment is a promising tool in the field of tissue decellularization and tissue banking.
31358727 | Comparative characterization of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived from patients with schizophrenia and autism. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) provide an attractive tool to study disease mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. A pertinent problem is the development of hiPSC-based assays to discriminate schizophrenia (SZ) from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) models. Healthy control individuals as well as patients with SZ and ASD were examined by a panel of diagnostic tests. Subsequently, skin biopsies were taken for the generation, differentiation, and testing of hiPSC-derived neurons from all individuals. SZ and ASD neurons share a reduced capacity for cortical differentiation as shown by quantitative analysis of the synaptic marker PSD95 and neurite outgrowth. By contrast, pattern analysis of calcium signals turned out to discriminate among healthy control, schizophrenia, and autism samples. Schizophrenia neurons displayed decreased peak frequency accompanied by increased peak areas, while autism neurons showed a slight decrease in peak amplitudes. For further analysis of the schizophrenia phenotype, transcriptome analyses revealed a clear discrimination among schizophrenia, autism, and healthy controls based on differentially expressed genes. However, considerable differences were still evident among schizophrenia patients under inspection. For one individual with schizophrenia, expression analysis revealed deregulation of genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) presentation pathway. Interestingly, antipsychotic treatment of healthy control neurons also increased MHC class II expression. In conclusion, transcriptome analysis combined with pattern analysis of calcium signals appeared as a tool to discriminate between SZ and ASD phenotypes in vitro.
34960747 | Pathological Features of Echovirus-11-Associated Brain Damage in Mice Based on RNA-Seq Analysis. Echovirus 11 (E11) is a neurotropic virus that occasionally causes fatal neurological diseases in infected children. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the disease and pathological spectrum of E11 infection remains unclear. Therefore, we modelled E11 infection in 2-day-old type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice, which are susceptible to enteroviruses, with E11, and identified symptoms consistent with the clinical signs observed in human cases. All organs of infected suckling mice were found to show viral replication and pathological changes; the muscle tissue showed the highest viral replication, whereas the brain and muscle tissues showed the most obvious pathological changes. Brain tissues showed oedema and a large number of dead nerve cells; RNA-Seq analysis of the brain and hindlimb muscle tissues revealed differentially expressed genes to be abundantly enriched in immune response-related pathways, with changes in the Guanylate-binding protein (GBP) and MHC class genes, causing aseptic meningitis-related symptoms. Furthermore, human glioma U251 cell was identified as sensitive target cells for E11 infection. Overall, these results provide new insights into the pathogenesis and progress of aseptic meningitis caused by E11.
36563336 | Flotetuzumab and other T-cell immunotherapies upregulate MHC class II expression on acute myeloid leukemia cells. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse is one of the most common and significant adverse events following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Downregulation of major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) surface expression on AML blasts may represent a mechanism of escape from the graft-versus-malignancy effect and facilitate relapse. We hypothesized that T-cell immunotherapies targeting AML antigens would upregulate MHC-II surface expression via localized release of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), a protein known to upregulate MHC-II expression via JAK-STAT signaling. We demonstrate that flotetuzumab (FLZ), a CD123 x CD3 bispecific DART molecule, and chimeric antigen receptor expressing T cells targeting CD123, CD33, or CD371 upregulate MHC-II surface expression in vitro on a THP-1 AML cell line with intermediate MHC-II expression and 4 primary AML samples from patients relapsing after HCT with low MHC-II expression. We additionally show that FLZ upregulates MHC-II expression in a patient-derived xenograft model and in patients with relapsed or refractory AML who were treated with FLZ in a clinical trial. Finally, we report that FLZ-induced MHC-II upregulation is mediated by IFN-gamma. In conclusion, we provide evidence that T-cell immunotherapies targeting relapsed AML can kill AML via both MHC-independent mechanisms and by an MHC-dependent mechanism through local release of IFN-gamma and subsequent upregulation of MHC-II expression.
36711494 | Global Transcriptomics of Congenital Hepatic Fibrosis in Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease using PCK rats. Congenital hepatic fibrosis / Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (CHF/ARPKD) is an inherited neonatal disease induced by mutations in the PKHD1 gene and characterized by cysts, and robust pericystic fibrosis in liver and kidney. The PCK rat is an excellent animal model which carries a Pkhd1 mutation and exhibits similar pathophysiology. We performed RNA-Seq analysis on liver samples from PCK rats over a time course of postnatal day (PND) 15, 20, 30, and 90 using age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats as controls to characterize molecular mechanisms of CHF/ARPKD pathogenesis. A comprehensive differential gene expression (DEG) analysis identified 1298 DEGs between PCK and SD rats. The genes overexpressed in the PCK rats at PND 30 and 90 were involved cell migration (e.g. Lamc2, Tgfb2 , and Plet1 ), cell adhesion (e.g. Spp1, Adgrg1 , and Cd44 ), and wound healing (e.g. Plat, Celsr1, Tpm1 ). Connective tissue growth factor ( Ctgf ) and platelet-derived growth factor ( Pdgfb ), two genes associated with fibrosis, were upregulated in PCK rats at all time-points. Genes associated with MHC class I molecules (e.g. RT1-A2 ) or involved in ribosome assembly (e.g. Pes1 ) were significantly downregulated in PCK rats. Upstream regulator analysis showed activation of proteins involved tissue growth (MTPN) and inflammation (STAT family members) and chromatin remodeling (BRG1), and inhibition of proteins involved in hepatic differentiation (HNF4alpha) and reduction of fibrosis (SMAD7). The increase in mRNAs of four top upregulated genes including Reg3b, Aoc1, Tm4sf20 , and Cdx2 was confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, these studies indicate that a combination of increased inflammation, cell migration and wound healing, and inhibition of hepatic function, decreased antifibrotic gene expression are the major underlying pathogenic mechanisms in CHF/ARPKD.
36726278 | HPAI-resistant Ri chickens exhibit elevated antiviral immune-related gene expression. BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) is an extremely contagious and high mortality rates in chickens resulting in substantial economic impact on the poultry sector. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of HPAIV for infection control. OBJECTIVE: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) can effectively avoid the limitations of subjective screening for differential gene expression. Therefore, we performed GSEA to compare HPAI-infected resistant and susceptible Ri chicken lines. METHODS: The Ri chickens Mx(A)/BF2(B21) were chosen as resistant, and the chickens Mx(G)/BF2(B13) were selected as susceptible by genotyping the Mx and BF2 genes. The tracheal tissues of HPAIV H5N1 infected chickens were collected for RNA sequencing followed by GSEA analysis to define gene subsets to elucidate the sequencing results. RESULTS: We identified four differentially expressed pathways, which were immune-related pathways with a total of 78 genes. The expression levels of cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12), chemokines (CCL4 and CCL5), type interferons and their receptors (IFN-beta, IFNAR1, IFNAR2, and IFNGR1), Jak-STAT signaling pathway genes (STAT1, STAT2, and JAK1), MHC class I and II and their co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, DMB2, BLB2, and B2M), and interferon stimulated genes (EIF2AK2 and EIF2AK1) in resistant chickens were higher than those in susceptible chickens. CONCLUSIONS: Resistant Ri chickens exhibit a stronger antiviral response to HPAIV H5N1 compared with susceptible chickens. Our findings provide insights into the immune responses of genetically disparate chickens against HPAIV.
36776884 | Single-cell sequencing combined with machine learning reveals the mechanism of interaction between epilepsy and stress cardiomyopathy. Background: Epilepsy is a disorder that can manifest as abnormalities in neurological or physical function. Stress cardiomyopathy is closely associated with neurological stimulation. However, the mechanisms underlying the interrelationship between epilepsy and stress cardiomyopathy are unclear. This paper aims to explore the genetic features and potential molecular mechanisms shared in epilepsy and stress cardiomyopathy. Methods: By analyzing the epilepsy dataset and stress cardiomyopathy dataset separately, the intersection of the two disease co-expressed differential genes is obtained, the co-expressed differential genes reveal the biological functions, the network is constructed, and the core modules are identified to reveal the interaction mechanism, the co-expressed genes with diagnostic validity are screened by machine learning algorithms, and the co-expressed genes are validated in parallel on the epilepsy single-cell data and the stress cardiomyopathy rat model. Results: Epilepsy causes stress cardiomyopathy, and its key pathways are Complement and coagulation cascades, HIF-1 signaling pathway, its key co-expressed genes include SPOCK2, CTSZ, HLA-DMB, ALDOA, SFRP1, ERBB3. The key immune cell subpopulations localized by single-cell data are the T_cells subgroup, Microglia subgroup, Macrophage subgroup, Astrocyte subgroup, and Oligodendrocytes subgroup. Conclusion: We believe epilepsy causing stress cardiomyopathy results from a multi-gene, multi-pathway combination. We identified the core co-expressed genes (SPOCK2, CTSZ, HLA-DMB, ALDOA, SFRP1, ERBB3) and the pathways that function in them (Complement and coagulation cascades, HIF-1 signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway), and finally localized their key cellular subgroups (T_cells subgroup, Microglia subgroup, Macrophage subgroup, Astrocyte subgroup, and Oligodendrocytes subgroup). Also, combining cell subpopulations with hypercoagulability as well as sympathetic excitation further narrowed the cell subpopulations of related functions.
36916035 | Effects of calreticulin mutations on cell transformation and immunity. Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are cancers involving dysregulated production and function of myeloid lineage hematopoietic cells. Among MPNs, Essential thrombocythemia (ET), Polycythemia Vera (PV) and Myelofibrosis (MF), are driven by mutations that activate the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Somatic mutations of calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized lectin chaperone, are driver mutations in approximately 25% of ET and 35% of MF patients. The MPN-linked mutant CRT proteins have novel frameshifted carboxy-domain sequences and lack an ER retention motif, resulting in their secretion. Wild type CRT is a regulator of ER calcium homeostasis and plays a key role in the assembly of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which are the ligands for antigen receptors of CD8+ T cells. Mutant CRT-linked oncogenesis results from the dysregulation of calcium signalling in cells and the formation of stable complexes of mutant CRT with myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) protein, followed by downstream activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. The intricate participation of CRT in ER protein folding, calcium homeostasis and immunity suggests the involvement of multiple mechanisms of mutant CRT-linked oncogenesis. In this review, we highlight recent findings related to the role of MPN-linked CRT mutations in the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, MPL activation and immunity.
36946463 | JAK-STAT activation contributes to cytotoxic T cell-mediated basal cell death in human chronic lung allograft dysfunction. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading cause of death in lung transplant recipients. CLAD is characterized clinically by a persistent decline in pulmonary function and histologically by the development of airway-centered fibrosis known as bronchiolitis obliterans. There are no approved therapies to treat CLAD, and the mechanisms underlying its development remain poorly understood. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomic analysis of explanted tissues from human lung recipients with CLAD, and we performed independent validation studies to identify an important role of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling in airway epithelial cells that contributes to airway-specific alloimmune injury. Specifically, we established that activation of JAK-STAT signaling leads to upregulation of major histocompatibility complex 1 (MHC-I) in airway basal cells, an important airway epithelial progenitor population, which leads to cytotoxic T cell-mediated basal cell death. This study provides mechanistic insight into the cell-to-cell interactions driving airway-centric alloimmune injury in CLAD, suggesting a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for CLAD prevention or treatment.
37113134 | Identifying key genes related to inflammasome in severe COVID-19 patients based on a joint model with random forest and artificial neural network. Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading astonishingly and caused catastrophic losses worldwide. The high mortality of severe COVID-19 patients is an serious problem that needs to be solved urgently. However, the biomarkers and fundamental pathological mechanisms of severe COVID-19 are poorly understood. The aims of this study was to explore key genes related to inflammasome in severe COVID-19 and their potential molecular mechanisms using random forest and artificial neural network modeling. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in severe COVID-19 were screened from GSE151764 and GSE183533 via comprehensive transcriptome Meta-analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional analyses were conducted to identify molecular mechanisms related to DEGs or DEGs associated with inflammasome (IADEGs), respectively. Five the most important IADEGs in severe COVID-19 were explored using random forest. Then, we put these five IADEGs into an artificial neural network to construct a novel diagnostic model for severe COVID-19 and verified its diagnostic efficacy in GSE205099. Results: Using combining P value < 0.05, we obtained 192 DEGs, 40 of which are IADEGs. The GO enrichment analysis results indicated that 192 DEGs were mainly involved in T cell activation, MHC protein complex and immune receptor activity. The KEGG enrichment analysis results indicated that 192 GEGs were mainly involved in Th17 cell differentiation, IL-17 signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. In addition, the top GO terms of 40 IADEGs were involved in T cell activation, immune response-activating signal transduction, external side of plasma membrane and phosphatase binding. The KEGG enrichment analysis results indicated that IADEGs were mainly involved in FoxO signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor, JAK-STAT signaling pathway and Apoptosis. Then, five important IADEGs (AXL, MKI67, CDKN3, BCL2 and PTGS2) for severe COVID-19 were screened by random forest analysis. By building an artificial neural network model, we found that the AUC values of 5 important IADEGs were 0.972 and 0.844 in the train group (GSE151764 and GSE183533) and test group (GSE205099), respectively. Conclusion: The five genes related to inflammasome, including AXL, MKI67, CDKN3, BCL2 and PTGS2, are important for severe COVID-19 patients, and these molecules are related to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, AXL, MKI67, CDKN3, BCL2 and PTGS2 as a marker combination could be used as potential markers to identify severe COVID-19 patients.
37149242 | Mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury are attenuated by nandrolone: Role of JAK-STAT3 pathway. AIM: To investigate the effect of acute treatment with the anabolic steroid (AS) nandrolone decanoate in mitochondrial homeostasis and JAK-STAT3 signaling during the progression of cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury (IR). METHODS: Male Wistar rats (2 months old) were randomly allocated into four experimental groups: Control (CTRL), IR, AS, and AS+AG490. All animals were euthanized 3 days after a single intramuscular injection of nandrolone at 10 mg/kg (AS and AS+AG490 groups) or vehicle (CTRL and IR groups). Baseline mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and 2, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) alpha and beta were compared between CTRL and AS groups. Isolated hearts were submitted to ex vivo ischemia and reperfusion, except for hearts from the CTRL group. Before the IR protocol, the JAK-STAT3 inhibitor AG490 was perfused in hearts from the AS+AG490 group. Heart samples were collected during reperfusion to investigate the effects on mitochondrial function. Results Antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression was unaffected, whereas the AS group exhibited decreased beta- MHC/alpha-MHC ratio versus the CTRL group. Compared to the IR group, the AS group exhibited better recovery of post-ischemic left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure and LV-developed pressure levels, while infarct size significantly decreased. Furthermore, mitochondrial production, transmembrane potential, and swelling were improved, whereas ROS formation was decreased versus the IR group. These effects were prevented by the perfusion of JAK-STAT3 inhibitor AG490. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that acute nandrolone treatment can provide cardioprotection by recruiting the JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway and mitochondrial preservation.
37293126 | Inflammation versus regulation: how interferon-gamma contributes to type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease with onset from early childhood. The insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The disease is challenging to study mechanistically in humans because it is not possible to biopsy the pancreatic islets and the disease is most active prior to the time of clinical diagnosis. The NOD mouse model, with many similarities to, but also some significant differences from human diabetes, provides an opportunity, in a single in-bred genotype, to explore pathogenic mechanisms in molecular detail. The pleiotropic cytokine IFN-gamma is believed to contribute to pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Evidence of IFN-gamma signaling in the islets, including activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and upregulation of MHC class I, are hallmarks of the disease. IFN-gamma has a proinflammatory role that is important for homing of autoreactive T cells into islets and direct recognition of beta cells by CD8+ T cells. We recently showed that IFN-gamma also controls proliferation of autoreactive T cells. Therefore, inhibition of IFN-gamma does not prevent type 1 diabetes and is unlikely to be a good therapeutic target. In this manuscript we review the contrasting roles of IFN-gamma in driving inflammation and regulating the number of antigen specific CD8+ T cells in type 1 diabetes. We also discuss the potential to use JAK inhibitors as therapy for type 1 diabetes, to inhibit both cytokine-mediated inflammation and proliferation of T cells.
37395687 | Adaptation of the Tumor Antigen Presentation Machinery to Ionizing Radiation. Ionizing radiation (IR) can reprogram proteasome structure and function in cells and tissues. In this article, we show that IR can promote immunoproteasome synthesis with important implications for Ag processing and presentation and tumor immunity. Irradiation of a murine fibrosarcoma (FSA) induced dose-dependent de novo biosynthesis of the immunoproteasome subunits LMP7, LMP2, and Mecl-1, in concert with other changes in the Ag-presentation machinery (APM) essential for CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity, including enhanced expression of MHC class I (MHC-I), beta2-microglobulin, transporters associated with Ag processing molecules, and their key transcriptional activator NOD-like receptor family CARD domain containing 5. In contrast, in another less immunogenic, murine fibrosarcoma (NFSA), LMP7 transcripts and expression of components of the immunoproteasome and the APM were muted after IR, which affected MHC-I expression and CD8+ T lymphocyte infiltration into NFSA tumors in vivo. Introduction of LMP7 into NFSA largely corrected these deficiencies, enhancing MHC-I expression and in vivo tumor immunogenicity. The immune adaptation in response to IR mirrored many aspects of the response to IFN-gamma in coordinating the transcriptional MHC-I program, albeit with notable differences. Further investigations showed divergent upstream pathways in that, unlike IFN-gamma, IR failed to activate STAT-1 in either FSA or NFSA cells while heavily relying on NF-kappaB activation. The IR-induced shift toward immunoproteasome production within a tumor indicates that proteasomal reprogramming is part of an integrated and dynamic tumor-host response that is specific to the stressor and the tumor and therefore is of clinical relevance for radiation oncology.
37446885 | Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Immunoregulatory Activity of Rice Seed-Derived Peptide PEP1 on Dendritic Cells. Some food-derived bioactive peptides exhibit prominent immunoregulatory activity. We previously demonstrated that the rice-derived PEP1 peptide, GIAASPFLQSAAFQLR, has strong immunological activity. However, the mechanism of this action is still unclear. In the present study, full-length transcripts of mouse dendritic cells (DC2.4) treated with PEP1 were sequenced using the PacBio sequencing platform, and the transcriptomes were compared via RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The characteristic markers of mature DCs, the cluster of differentiation CD86, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II), were significantly upregulated after the PEP1 treatment. The molecular docking suggested that hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions played important roles in the binding between PEP1, MHC-II, and the T-cell receptor (TCR). In addition, the PEP1 peptide increased the release of anti-inflammatory factors (interleukin-4 and interleukin-10) and decreased the release of pro-inflammatory factors (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Furthermore, the RNA-seq results showed the expression of genes involved in several signaling pathways, such as the NF-kappaB, MAPK, JAK-STAT, and TGF-beta pathways, were regulated by the PEP1 treatment, and the changes confirmed the immunomodulatory effect of PEP1 on DC2.4 cells. This findings revealed that the PEP1 peptide, derived from the byproduct of rice processing, is a potential natural immunoregulatory alternative for the treatment of inflammation.
37854597 | Deucravacitinib, a tyrosine kinase 2 pseudokinase inhibitor, protects human EndoC-betaH1 beta-cells against proinflammatory insults. Introduction: Type 1 diabetes is characterized by pancreatic islet inflammation and autoimmune-driven pancreatic beta-cell destruction. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is a key player in early human type 1 diabetes pathogenesis. IFNalpha activates the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, leading to inflammation, HLA class I overexpression, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and beta-cell apoptosis (in synergy with IL-1beta). As TYK2 inhibition has raised as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of type 1 diabetes, we investigated whether the selective TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib could protect beta-cells from the effects of IFNalpha and other proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., IFNgamma and IL-1beta). Methods: All experiments were performed in the human EndoC-betaH1 beta-cell line. HLA class I expression, inflammation, and ER stress were evaluated by real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and/or immunofluorescence. Apoptosis was assessed by the DNA-binding dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide or caspase 3/7 activity. The promoter activity was assessed by luciferase assay. Results: Deucravacitinib prevented IFNalpha effects, such as STAT1 and STAT2 activation and MHC class I hyperexpression, in a dose-dependent manner without affecting beta-cell survival and function. A comparison between deucravacitinib and two Janus kinase inhibitors, ruxolitinib and baricitinib, showed that deucravacitinib blocked IFNalpha- but not IFNgamma-induced signaling pathway. Deucravacitinib protected beta-cells from the effects of two different combinations of cytokines: IFNalpha + IL-1beta and IFNgamma + IL-1beta. Moreover, this TYK2 inhibitor could partially reduce apoptosis and inflammation in cells pre-treated with IFNalpha + IL-1beta or IFNgamma + IL-1beta. Discussion: Our findings suggest that, by protecting beta-cells against the deleterious effects of proinflammatory cytokines without affecting beta-cell function and survival, deucravacitinib could be repurposed for the prevention or treatment of early type 1 diabetes.
37916607 | Integrative modeling of guanylate binding protein dimers. Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are essential interferon-gamma-activated large GTPases that play a crucial role in host defense against intracellular bacteria and parasites. While their protective functions rely on protein polymerization, our understanding of the structural intricacies of these multimerized states remains limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, we present dimer models for human GBP1 (hGBP1) and murine GBP2 and 7 (mGBP2 and mGBP7) using an integrative approach, incorporating the crystal structure of hGBP1's GTPase domain dimer, crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our investigation begins by comparing the protein dynamics of hGBP1, mGBP2, and mGBP7. We observe that the M/E domain in all three proteins exhibits significant mobility and hinge motion, with mGBP7 displaying a slightly less pronounced motion but greater flexibility in its GTPase domain. These dynamic distinctions can be attributed to variations in the sequences of mGBP7 and hGBP1/mGBP2, resulting in different dimerization modes. Unlike hGBP1 and its close ortholog mGBP2, which exclusively dimerize through their GTPase domains, we find that mGBP7 exhibits three equally probable alternative dimer structures. The GTPase domain of mGBP7 is only partially involved in its dimerization, primarily due to an accumulation of negative charge, allowing mGBP7 to dimerize independently of GTP. Instead, mGBP7 exhibits a strong tendency to dimerize in an antiparallel arrangement across its stalks. The results of this work go beyond the sequence-structure-function relationship, as the sequence differences in mGBP7 and mGBP2/hGBP1 do not lead to different structures, but to different protein dynamics and dimerization. The distinct GBP dimer structures are expected to encode specific functions crucial for disrupting pathogen membranes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
37956745 | Genetic variants associated with hantavirus infection in a reservoir host are related to regulation of inflammation and immune surveillance. The immunogenetics of wildlife populations influence the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamic of the host-pathogen system. Profiling immune gene diversity present in wildlife may be especially important for those species that, while not at risk of disease or extinction themselves, are host to diseases that are a threat to humans, other wildlife, or livestock. Hantaviruses (genus: Orthohantavirus) are globally distributed zoonotic RNA viruses with pathogenic strains carried by a diverse group of rodent hosts. The marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) is the reservoir host of Orthohantavirus bayoui, a hantavirus that causes fatal cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in humans. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) using the rice rat \immunome\ (i.e., all exons related to the immune response) to identify genetic variants associated with infection status in wild-caught rice rats naturally infected with their endemic strain of hantavirus. First, we created an annotated reference genome using 10x Chromium Linked Reads sequencing technology. This reference genome was used to create custom baits which were then used to target enrich prepared rice rat libraries (n = 128) and isolate their immunomes prior to sequencing. Top SNPs in the association test were present in four genes (Socs5, Eprs, Mrc1 and Il1f8) which have not been previously implicated in hantavirus infections. However, these genes correspond with other loci or pathways with established importance in hantavirus susceptibility or infection tolerance in reservoir hosts: the JAK/STAT, MHC, and NFkappaB. These results serve as informative markers for future exploration and highlight the importance of immune pathways that repeatedly emerge across hantavirus systems. Our work aids in creating cross-species comparisons for better understanding mechanisms of genetic susceptibility and hostpathogen co-evolution in hantavirus systems.
37958732 | The Viral Protein Poly(A) Polymerase Catalytic Subunit Interacts with Guanylate-Binding Proteins 2 to Antagonize the Antiviral Ability of Targeting Ectromelia Virus. The recent spread of the monkeypox virus among humans has heightened concerns regarding orthopoxvirus infections. Consequently, conducting a comprehensive study on the immunobiology of the monkeypox virus is imperative for the development of effective therapeutics. Ectromelia virus (ECTV) closely resembles the genetic and disease characteristics of monkeypox virus, making it a valuable research tool for studying orthopoxvirus-host interactions. Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), highly expressed interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), have antagonistic effects against various intracellular pathogenic microorganisms. Our previous research has shown that GBP2 has a mild but statistically significant inhibitory effect on ECTV infection. The presence of a significant number of molecules in the poxvirus genome that encode the host immune response raises questions about whether it also includes proteins that counteract the antiviral activity of GBP2. Using IP/MS and co-IP technology, we discovered that the poly(A) polymerase catalytic subunit (PAPL) protein of ECTV is a viral regulatory molecule that interacts with GBP2. Further studies have shown that PAPL antagonizes the antiviral activity of GBP2 by reducing its protein levels. Knocking out the PAPL gene of ECTV with the CRISPR/Cas9 system significantly diminishes the replication ability of the virus, indicating the indispensable role of PAPL in the replication process of ECTV. In conclusion, our study presents preliminary evidence supporting the significance of PAPL as a virulence factor that can interact with GBP2.
38052854 | Leukemia-intrinsic determinants of CAR-T response revealed by iterative in vivo genome-wide CRISPR screening. CAR-T therapy is a promising, novel treatment modality for B-cell malignancies and yet many patients relapse through a variety of means, including loss of CAR-T cells and antigen escape. To investigate leukemia-intrinsic CAR-T resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in an immunocompetent murine model of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) utilizing a modular guide RNA library. We identified IFNgammaR/JAK/STAT signaling and components of antigen processing and presentation pathway as key mediators of resistance to CAR-T therapy in vivo; intriguingly, loss of this pathway yielded the opposite effect in vitro (sensitized leukemia to CAR-T cells). Transcriptional characterization of this model demonstrated upregulation of these pathways in tumors relapsed after CAR-T treatment, and functional studies showed a surprising role for natural killer (NK) cells in engaging this resistance program. Finally, examination of data from B-ALL patients treated with CAR-T revealed an association between poor outcomes and increased expression of JAK/STAT and MHC-I in leukemia cells. Overall, our data identify an unexpected mechanism of resistance to CAR-T therapy in which tumor cell interaction with the in vivo tumor microenvironment, including NK cells, induces expression of an adaptive, therapy-induced, T-cell resistance program in tumor cells.
38129801 | Unveiling promising immunogenic targets in Coxiella burnetii through in silico analysis: paving the way for novel vaccine strategies. BACKGROUND: Coxiella burnetii, an intracellular pathogen, serves as the causative agent of zoonotic Q fever. This pathogen presents a significant threat due to its potential for airborne transmission, environmental persistence, and pathogenicity. The current whole-cell vaccine (WCV) utilized in Australia to combat Q fever exhibits notable limitations, including severe adverse reactions and limited regulatory approval for human use. This research employed the reverse vaccinology (RV) approach to uncover antigenic proteins and epitopes of C. burnetii, facilitating the development of more potent vaccine candidates. METHODS: The potential immunogenic proteins derived from C. burnetii RSA493/Nine Mile phase I (NMI) were extracted through manual, automated RV, and virulence factor database (VFDB) methods. Web tools and bioinformatics were used to evaluate physiochemical attributes, subcellular localization, antigenicity, allergenicity, human homology, B-cell epitopes, MHC I and II binding ratios, functional class scores, adhesion probabilities, protein-protein interactions, and molecular docking. RESULTS: Out of the 1850 proteins encoded by RSA493/NMI, a subset of 178 demonstrated the potential for surface or membrane localization. Following a series of analytical iterations, 14 putative immunogenic proteins emerged. This collection included nine proteins (57.1%) intricately involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis processes (CBU_0197 (Q83EW1), CBU_0311 (Q83EK8), CBU_0489 (Q83E43), CBU_0939 (Q83D08), CBU_1190 (P39917), CBU_1829 (Q83AQ2), CBU_1412 (Q83BU0), CBU_1414 (Q83BT8), and CBU_1600 (Q83BB2)). The CBU_1627 (Q83B86 ) (7.1%) implicated in intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport, and CBU_0092 (Q83F57) (7.1%) contributing to cell division. Additionally, three proteins (21.4%) displayed uncharacterized functions (CBU_0736 (Q83DJ4), CBU_1095 (Q83CL9), and CBU_2079 (Q83A32)). The congruent results obtained from molecular docking and immune response stimulation lend support to the inclusion of all 14 putative proteins as potential vaccine candidates. Notably, seven proteins with well-defined functions stand out among these candidates. CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this study introduce promising proteins and epitopes for the forthcoming formulation of subunit vaccines against Q fever, with a primary emphasis on cellular processes and the virulence factors of C. burnetii.
38170178 | Staphylococcus aureus induce drug resistance in cancer T cells in Sezary Syndrome. Patients with Sezary syndrome (SS), a leukemic variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), are prone to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections and have a poor prognosis due to treatment-resistance. Here, we report that S. aureus and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) induce drug resistance in malignant T-cells against therapeutics commonly used in CTCL. Supernatant from patient-derived, SE-producing S. aureus and recombinant SE significantly inhibit cell death induced by HDAC inhibitor romidepsin in primary malignant T-cells from SS patients. Bacterial killing by engineered, bacteriophage-derived, S. aureus-specific endolysin (XZ.700) abrogates the effect of S. aureus supernatant. Likewise, mutations in MHC Class II binding sites of SE type-A (SEA) and anti-SEA antibody block induction of resistance. Importantly, SE also triggers resistance to other HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat and resminostat) and chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and etoposide). Multimodal single-cell sequencing indicates TCR, NF B, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways (previously associated with drug-resistance) as putative mediators of SE-induced drug resistance. In support, inhibition of TCR-signaling and Protein Kinase C (upstream of NF B) counteracts SE-induced rescue from drug-induced cell death. Inversely, SE cannot rescue from cell death induced by proteasome/NF B inhibitor bortezomib. Inhibition of JAK/STAT only blocks SE-induced rescue of malignant T-cells in some but not all patients, suggesting two distinct ways SE can induce drug resistance. In conclusion, we show that S. aureus enterotoxins induce drug-resistance in primary malignant T-cells. These findings suggest that S. aureus enterotoxins cause clinical treatment-resistance in SS patients and that anti-bacterial measures may improve the outcome of cancer-directed therapy in patients harboring S. aureus.
38213329 | Antigen presentation deficiency, mesenchymal differentiation, and resistance to immunotherapy in the murine syngeneic CT2A tumor model. Background: The GL261 and CT2A syngeneic tumor lines are frequently used as immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of human glioblastoma (huGBM) but demonstrate distinct differences in their responses to immunotherapy. Methods: To decipher the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that drive immunotherapy resistance in CT2A-luc and to define the aspects of human cancer biology that these lines can best model, we systematically compared their characteristics using whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, and protein analysis through immunohistochemistry, Western blot, flow cytometry, immunopeptidomics, and phosphopeptidomics. Results: The transcriptional profiles of GL261-luc2 and CT2A-luc tumors resembled those of some huGBMs, despite neither line sharing the essential genetic or histologic features of huGBM. Both models exhibited striking hypermutation, with clonal hotspot mutations in RAS genes (Kras p.G12C in GL261-luc2 and Nras p.Q61L in CT2A-luc). CT2A-luc distinctly displayed mesenchymal differentiation, upregulated angiogenesis, and multiple defects in antigen presentation machinery (e.g. Tap1 p.Y488C and Psmb8 p.A275P mutations) and interferon response pathways (e.g. copy number losses of loci including IFN genes and reduced phosphorylation of JAK/STAT pathway members). The defect in MHC class I expression could be overcome in CT2A-luc by interferon-gamma treatment, which may underlie the modest efficacy of some immunotherapy combinations. Additionally, CT2A-luc demonstrated substantial baseline secretion of the CCL-2, CCL-5, and CCL-22 chemokines, which play important roles as myeloid chemoattractants. Conclusion: Although the clinical contexts that can be modeled by GL261 and CT2A for huGBM are limited, CT2A may be an informative model of immunotherapy resistance due to its deficits in antigen presentation machinery and interferon response pathways.
38254219 | Crosstalk between colorectal CSCs and immune cells in tumorigenesis, and strategies for targeting colorectal CSCs. Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising strategy in the treatment of colorectal cancer, and relapse after tumor immunotherapy has attracted increasing attention. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small subset of tumor cells with self-renewal and differentiation capacities, are resistant to traditional therapies such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Recently, CSCs have been proven to be the cells driving tumor relapse after immunotherapy. However, the mutual interactions between CSCs and cancer niche immune cells are largely uncharacterized. In this review, we focus on colorectal CSCs, CSC-immune cell interactions and CSC-based immunotherapy. Colorectal CSCs are characterized by robust expression of surface markers such as CD44, CD133 and Lgr5; hyperactivation of stemness-related signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/beta-catenin, Hippo/Yap1, Jak/Stat and Notch pathways; and disordered epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNA action. Moreover, colorectal CSCs express abnormal levels of immune-related genes such as MHC and immune checkpoint molecules and mutually interact with cancer niche cells in multiple tumorigenesis-related processes, including tumor initiation, maintenance, metastasis and drug resistance. To date, many therapies targeting CSCs have been evaluated, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies, tumor vaccines adoptive cell therapy, and small molecule inhibitors. With the development of CSC-/niche-targeting technology, as well as the integration of multidisciplinary studies, novel therapies that eliminate CSCs and reverse their immunosuppressive microenvironment are expected to be developed for the treatment of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer.
38396958 | Cytokine Signaling in Pediatric Kidney Tumor Cell Lines WT-CLS1, WT-3ab and G-401. Renal tumors comprise ~7% of all malignant pediatric tumors. Approximately 90% of pediatric kidney tumors comprise Wilms tumors, and the remaining 10% include clear cell sarcoma of the kidney, malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, renal cell carcinoma and other rare renal tumors. Over the last 30 years, the role of cytokines and their receptors has been considerably investigated in both cancer progression and anti-cancer therapy. However, more effective immunotherapies require the cytokine profiling of each tumor type and comprehensive understanding of tumor biology. In this study, we aimed to investigate the activation of signaling pathways in response to cytokines in three pediatric kidney tumor cell lines, in WT-CLS1 and WT-3ab cells (both are Wilms tumors), and in G-401 cells (a rhabdoid kidney tumor, formerly classified as Wilms tumor). We observed that interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) very strongly induced the activation of the STAT1 protein, whereas IL-6 and IFN-alpha activated STAT3 and IL-4 activated STAT6 in all examined tumor cell lines. STAT protein activation was examined by flow cytometry and Western blot using phospho-specific anti-STAT antibodies which recognize only activated (phosphorylated) STAT proteins. Nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT proteins upon activation with specific cytokines was furthermore confirmed by immunofluorescence. Our results also showed that both IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma caused upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins, however, these cytokines did not have any effect on the expression of MHC class II proteins. We also observed that pediatric kidney tumor cell lines exhibit the functional expression of an additional cytokine signaling pathway, the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). In summary, our data show that human pediatric renal tumor cell lines are responsive to stimulation with various human cytokines and could be used as in vitro models for profiling cytokine signaling pathways.
38431607 | Golden bile powder prevents drunkenness and alcohol-induced liver injury in mice via the gut microbiota and metabolic modulation. BACKGROUND: Drunkenness and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) are critical public health issues associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to chronic overconsumption of alcohol. Traditional remedies, such as bear bile powder, have been historically acclaimed for their hepatoprotective properties. This study assessed the efficacy of a biotransformed bear bile powder known as golden bile powder (GBP) in alleviating alcohol-induced drunkenness and ALD. METHODS: A murine model was engineered to simulate alcohol drunkenness and acute hepatic injury through the administration of a 50% ethanol solution. Intervention with GBP and its effects on alcohol-related symptoms were scrutinized, by employing an integrative approach that encompasses serum metabolomics, network medicine, and gut microbiota profiling to elucidate the protective mechanisms of GBP. RESULTS: GBP administration significantly delayed the onset of drunkenness and decreased the duration of ethanol-induced inebriation in mice. Enhanced liver cell recovery was indicated by increased hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase levels and superoxide dismutase activity, along with significant decreases in the serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride, and total cholesterol levels (P < 0.05). These biochemical alterations suggest diminished hepatic damage and enhanced lipid homeostasis. Microbiota analysis via 16S rDNA sequencing revealed significant changes in gut microbial diversity and composition following alcohol exposure, and these changes were effectively reversed by GBP treatment. Metabolomic analyses demonstrated that GBP normalized the alcohol-induced perturbations in phospholipids, fatty acids, and bile acids. Correlation assessments linked distinct microbial genera to serum bile acid profiles, indicating that the protective efficacy of GBP may be attributable to modulatory effects on metabolism and the gut microbiota composition. Network medicine insights suggest the prominence of two active agents in GBP as critical for addressing drunkenness and ALD. CONCLUSION: GBP is a potent intervention for alcohol-induced pathology and offers hepatoprotective benefits, at least in part, through the modulation of the gut microbiota and related metabolic cascades.
38451230 | A comparison of short-read, HiFi long-read, and hybrid strategies for genome-resolved metagenomics. Shotgun metagenomics enables the reconstruction of complex microbial communities at a high level of detail. Such an approach can be conducted using both short-read and long-read sequencing data, as well as a combination of both. To assess the pros and cons of these different approaches, we used 22 fecal DNA extracts collected weekly for 11 weeks from two respective lab mice to study seven performance metrics over four combinations of sequencing depth and technology: (i) 20 Gbp of Illumina short-read data, (ii) 40 Gbp of short-read data, (iii) 20 Gbp of PacBio HiFi long-read data, and (iv) 40 Gbp of hybrid (20 Gbp of short-read +20 Gbp of long-read) data. No strategy was best for all metrics; instead, each one excelled across different metrics. The long-read approach yielded the best assembly statistics, with the highest N50 and lowest number of contigs. The 40 Gbp short-read approach yielded the highest number of refined bins. Finally, the hybrid approach yielded the longest assemblies and the highest mapping rate to the bacterial genomes. Our results suggest that while long-read sequencing significantly improves the quality of reconstructed bacterial genomes, it is more expensive and requires deeper sequencing than short-read approaches to recover a comparable amount of reconstructed genomes. The most optimal strategy is study-specific and depends on how researchers assess the trade-off between the quantity and quality of recovered genomes.IMPORTANCEMice are an important model organism for understanding the gut microbiome. When studying these gut microbiomes using DNA techniques, researchers can choose from technologies that use short or long DNA reads. In this study, we perform an extensive benchmark between short- and long-read DNA sequencing for studying mice gut microbiomes. We find that no one approach was best for all metrics and provide information that can help guide researchers in planning their experiments.
38499166 | Transcriptome profiling of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) head kidney to Renibacterium salmoninarum at early and chronic infection stages. Renibacterium salmoninarum causes Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) in several fish species. Atlantic lumpfish, a cleaner fish, is susceptible to R. salmoninarum. To profile the transcriptome response of lumpfish to R. salmoninarum at early and chronic infection stages, fish were intraperitoneally injected with either a high dose of R. salmoninarum (1 x 109 cells dose-1) or PBS (control). Head kidney tissue samples were collected at 28- and 98-days post-infection (dpi) for RNA sequencing. Transcriptomic profiling identified 1971 and 139 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in infected compared with control samples at 28 and 98 dpi, respectively. At 28 dpi, R. salmoninarum-induced genes (n = 434) mainly involved in innate and adaptive immune response-related pathways, whereas R. salmoninarum-suppressed genes (n = 1537) were largely connected to amino acid metabolism and cellular processes. Cell-mediated immunity-related genes showed dysregulation at 98 dpi. Several immune-signalling pathways were dysregulated in response to R. salmoninarum, including apoptosis, alternative complement, JAK-STAT signalling, and MHC-I dependent pathways. In summary, R. salmoninarum causes immune suppression at early infection, whereas lumpfish induce a cell-mediated immune response at chronic infection. This study provides a complete depiction of diverse immune mechanisms dysregulated by R. salmoninarum in lumpfish and opens new avenues to develop immune prophylactic tools to prevent BKD.
38538595 | iNOS is necessary for GBP-mediated T. gondii clearance in murine macrophages via vacuole nitration and intravacuolar network collapse. Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of rodents and humans. Interferon-inducible guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) are mediators of T. gondii clearance, however, this mechanism is incomplete. Here, using automated spatially targeted optical micro proteomics we demonstrate that inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) is highly enriched at GBP2+ parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) in murine macrophages. iNOS expression in macrophages is necessary to limit T. gondii load in vivo and in vitro. Although iNOS activity is dispensable for GBP2 recruitment and PV membrane ruffling; parasites can replicate, egress and shed GBP2 when iNOS is inhibited. T. gondii clearance by iNOS requires nitric oxide, leading to nitration of the PV and collapse of the intravacuolar network of membranes in a chromosome 3 GBP-dependent manner. We conclude that reactive nitrogen species generated by iNOS cooperate with GBPs to target distinct structures in the PV that are necessary for optimal parasite clearance in macrophages.
38574622 | Antinociceptive effect of LMH-2, a new sigma-1 receptor antagonist analog of haloperidol, on the neuropathic pain of diabetic mice. This study evaluates the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of LMH-2, a new haloperidol (HAL) analog that acts as sigma-1 receptor (sigma1 R) antagonist, in diabetic mice using a model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic hyperglycemia. Additionally, we compared its effects with those of HAL. Hyperglycemia was induced in mice by nicotinamide-streptozotocin administration (NA-STZ, 50-130 mg/kg). Four weeks later, mechanical allodynia was assessed using the up-down method, and hyperalgesia was evoked with formalin 0.5%. We evaluated antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects of LMH-2 (5.6-56.2 mg/kg), HAL (0.018-0.18 mg/kg) and gabapentin (GBP, 5.6-56.2 mg/kg). The results showed that LMH-2 had a more significant antiallodynic effect compared to HAL and GBP (90.4+-8.7 vs 75.1+-3.1 and 41.9+-2.3%, respectively; P<0.05), as well as an antihyperalgesic effect (96.3+-1.2 vs 86.9+-7.41 and 86.9+-4.8%, respectively; P<0.05). Moreover, the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effect of both LMH-2 and HAL were completely abolished by PRE-084 (sigma1 R agonist); and partially by pramipexole (a D2-like receptor agonist). Finally, the effect of all treatments on the rotarod test, barra, open field and exploratory behaviors showed that LMH-2 did not alter the animals' balance or the exploratory behavior, unlike as HAL or GBP. The molecular docking included indicate that LMH-2 has lower affinity to the D2R than HAL. These results provide evidence that LMH-2 exerts its antinociceptive effects as a sigma1 R antagonist without the adverse effects induced by HAL or GBP. Consequently, LMH-2 can be considered a good and safe strategy for treating neuropathic pain caused by hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.
17385902 | An improved method for covalently conjugating morpholino oligomers to antitumor antibodies. Whether for conventional pretargeting, amplification pretargeting, or affinity enhancement pretargeting, it will be necessary to conjugate an antitumor antibody as the first injectate. This laboratory is investigating phosphorodiamidate morpholinos (MORFs) for pretargeting, and accordingly we are examining methods of attaching MORFs to antitumor antibodies that provide at least one group per molecule (gpm) without adversely influencing antibody properties. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the commercial Hydralink for the conjugation of the anti-CEA MN14 antibody with an 18 mer amine-derivatized MORF. The conjugation was approached in both directions by first reacting MN14 with the NHS derivatives of 4-hydrozinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (SANH) or 4-formylbenzoate (SFB) and then combining with MORF that was previously reacted with SFB or SANH to yield MN14(SANH)-MORF and MN14(SFB)-MORF respectively. The storage stability, immunoreactive fraction, and the biodistribution in normal mice were compared for both conjugates. Thereafter, MN14(SANH)-MORF was used in a pretargeting study in tumored nude mice, and the results were compared to that obtained historically with MN14-MORF prepared by carbodiimide (EDC) coupling. Both new methods of conjugation provided between 1 and 2 gpm compared to 0.2 achieved previously by EDC. Furthermore, by repeat SE HPLC with and without CEA, both showed an unimpaired immunoreactive fraction. MN14(SANH)-MORF tolerated long-term storage best. More importantly, when labeled by hybridization with 99mTc-labeled complementary MORF (99mTc-cMORF), the biodistribution of MN14(SANH)-MORF was more favorable than that of MN14(SFB)-MORF in normal mice with lower liver (5.7 vs 9.4 %ID/g at 18 h) and spleen (3.5 vs 8.4 %ID/g) accumulations and higher blood levels (4.8 vs 3.4 %ID/g). Accordingly, only MN14(SANH)-MORF was used in a pretargeting study in tumored mice. When targeted with 99mTc-cMORF and at 2 days postinjection of antibody-MORF, the results obtained with 6 microg of antibody prepared in this way were essentially identical to that obtained previously with 30 microg of antibody prepared via EDC. Hydralink was used successfully to conjugate MORF to MN14 at higher gpm than that achieved earlier and without an obvious compromise of properties. Using MN14(SANH)-MORF, the influence of the higher gpm on pretargeting permitted lowering the dosages of MN14 administered and may permit administering higher levels of radioactivity in connection with therapy.
17508710 | Synthesis and testing of a binary catalytic system for imaging of signal amplification in vivo. We report a binary targeted enzymatic system that is composed of two covalent monoclonal antibody conjugates for specific labeling of cellular targets in vivo. The system utilizes low-molecular weight peroxidase-reducing substrates synthesized by linking 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) with DTPA (5HT-DTPA) for magnetic resonance and radionuclide imaging or with Cy5.5 for near-infrared optical imaging. Initially, the conjugation reaction conditions were optimized to achieve a low level of antiepidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody (EMD 72000) modification with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of 4-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (SANH), yielding mAb-HNH conjugate. The resultant modified antibodies were incubated with the periodate-oxidized peroxidase (HRP) or 4-formylbenzoyl-conjugated glucose oxidase (GO), followed by the purification of the resultant mAb-enzyme conjugates by size-exclusion HPLC. The conjugates were further characterized by electrophoresis and were tested by cross-titration on A431 EGFR+ squamous carcinoma or SW620 adenocarcinoma cells (negative control). The conjugates at the optimized concentration ratios were further tested using near-infrared fluorescence microscopy in the presence of Cy5.5 monocarboxy-5-hydroxytryptamide. Further in vitro experiments demonstrated that (1) antibody binding was specific and could be inhibited by free antibody; (2) both antibody conjugates exhibited high enzymatic activity after the binding to the cells; (3) 111In-labeled 5-HT-DTPA was avidly binding to EGFR-positive cells only if both HRP- and GO-conjugates were bound to the cells. The conjugates were tested in vivo using a SPECT imaging experiment, which demonstrated the accumulation of 111In-labeled 5-HT-DTPA substrate at the site containing both conjugates.
24566605 | Utilization of the Local Government Health Insurance Scheme (JKA) for Maternal Health Services Among Women Living in Underdeveloped Areas of Aceh Province, Indonesia. Aceh province of Indonesia created its own health coverage scheme called Jaminan Kesehatan Aceh (JKA) to cover Aceh's populations who were not registered under insurance for the poor (Jamkesmas). This study aims to compare the utilization rate of maternal health care (MHC) services and contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) before JKA, during the transition period, and after JKA had been established. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted from June 2011 to July 2012. Utilization of MHC services and CPR during the 3 periods was assessed using a questionnaire. The Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test was used to examine the association between period and coverage. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to examine utilization and type of service, period of service, and type of scheme. Coverage of utilization of skilled birth attendants significantly improved among the JKA holders (odds ratio = 1.84; 95% confidence interval = 1.18-2.89). JKA, thus, has shown its positive impact. 
24602261 | Whole genome sequencing of the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix): reference guided assembly suggests faster-Z and MHC evolution. BACKGROUND: The different regions of a genome do not evolve at the same rate. For example, comparative genomic studies have suggested that the sex chromosomes and the regions harbouring the immune defence genes in the Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) may evolve faster than other genomic regions. The advent of the next generation sequencing technologies has made it possible to study which genomic regions are evolutionary liable to change and which are static, as well as enabling an increasing number of genome studies of non-model species. However, de novo sequencing of the whole genome of an organism remains non-trivial. In this study, we present the draft genome of the black grouse, which was developed using a reference-guided assembly strategy. RESULTS: We generated 133 Gbp of sequence data from one black grouse individual by the SOLiD platform and used a combination of de novo assembly and chicken reference genome mapping to assemble the reads into 4572 scaffolds with a total length of 1022 Mb. The draft genome well covers the main chicken chromosomes 1 ~ 28 and Z which have a total length of 1001 Mb. The draft genome is fragmented, but has a good coverage of the homologous chicken genes. Especially, 33.0% of the coding regions of the homologous genes have more than 90% proportion of their sequences covered. In addition, we identified ~1 M SNPs from the genome and identified 106 genomic regions which had a high nucleotide divergence between black grouse and chicken or between black grouse and turkey. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the chromosome X (Z) evolves faster than the autosomes and our data are consistent with the MHC regions being more liable to change than the genome average. Our study demonstrates how a moderate sequencing effort can be combined with existing genome references to generate a draft genome for a non-model species.
25191092 | Extracts of medicinal herb Sanguisorba officinalis inhibit the entry of human immunodeficiency virus type one. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in reducing HIV-1-associated morbidity and mortality since its introduction in 1996. It, however, fails to eradicate HIV-1 infection thoroughly. The high cost of life-long HAART and the emergence of drug resistance among HIV-1-infected individuals have brought renewed pressure for the discovery of novel antivirals and alternative medicines. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the mainstreams of complementary and alternative medicine, and serves as rich resources for new drug development. Despite almost 100 plant-derived compounds are in clinical trials, few target HIV-1 infection. In this study, we discovered that extract of Sanguisorba officinalis (SOE) has anti-HIV-1 activities. Using a cell-based assay and single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelopes from HIV-1 or control viruses, we found that SOE exhibited significant inhibitory ability against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic HIV-1 (ADA and HXB2) with respective IC50 values of 1.91+-0.16 mug/ml and 3.70+-0.53 mug/ml. Interestingly, SOE also inhibited SIV infection but failed to block vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), SARS-CoV and influeunza H5N1 pseudoviruses. Furthermore, we showed that SOE had no effects on post-entry events of HIV-1 replication. It blocked entry by acting on viral envelope directly because SOE pre-treatment with the virus but not with cell lines expressing viral receptors showed the maximal inhibitory activity. In addition, SOE was able to inhibit reverse-transcription-inhibitor-resistant viruses (K103N, Y188L, and K103N/Y188L/G190A) and a protease-inhibitor-resistant strain (PI-2840). Our findings demonstrated SOE as a novel and specific entry inhibitor, which shed lights on the discovery of anti-HIV-1 drugs from traditional herbal medicines.
29263663 | Multifunctionalized polyethyleneimine-based nanocarriers for gene and chemotherapeutic drug combination therapy through one-step assembly strategy. Gene therapy combined with chemotherapy to achieve synergistic therapeutic effects has been a hot topic in recent years. In this project, the human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-encoding plasmid gene (TRAIL) and doxorubicin (Dox)-coloaded multi-functional nanocarrier was constructed based on the theory of circulation, accumulation, internalization, and release. Briefly, polyethyleneimine (PEI) was selected as skeleton material to synthesize PEI-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-TAT (PPT). Dox was conjugated to PEI using C6-succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (C6-SANH), and a pH-sensitive Dox-PEI (DP) conjugate was obtained. Then, intracellular cationic pH-sensitive cellular assistant PPT and DP were mixed to condense TRAIL, and TRAIL-Dox coloaded PPT/DP/TRAIL (PDT) nanocarriers were obtained by one-step assembly. TRAIL was completely condensed by DP or PPT when mass ratios (DP/PPT to TRAIL) were up to 100:64, which indicated that DP and PPT could be mixed at any ratio for TRAIL condensation. The intracellular uptake rate of PDT was enhanced (P<0.05) when the contents of PPT in PPT+DP increased from 0 to 30%. Free Dox and TRAIL-loaded nanocarriers (PPT/C6-SANH-PEI/TRAIL [PCT]) were selected as controls to verify the synergistic antitumor effects of PDT. Compared with free TRAIL, TRAIL-protein expression was upregulated by PDT and PCT on Western blotting assays. The in vitro cytotoxicity of PDT was significantly enhanced compared to free Dox and PCT (P<0.01). Furthermore, murine PDT nanocarriers showed higher in vivo antitumor ability than both the Dox group (P<0.05) and the murine PCT group (P<0.05). These results indicated that the TRAIL + Dox synergistic antitumor effect could be achieved by PDT, which paves the way to gene-drug combination therapy for cancer.
29657387 | Anti-inflammatory activity of Jatropha curcas Linn. latex in cream formulation on CD68 expression in mice skin wound.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amount of 12 two-months-old male mice were used between 30 and 40 g. To surgical procedures, wound skin incision was performed 2.0 cm in length until subcutaneous on the paravertebral of each animal. The treatment was carried under locally anesthetized with procaine cream. The mice were allotted into four groups of each, entire surface of each group wound covered by base cream control, sulfadiazine 0.1% cream, J. curcas latex cream 10% and, 15%, respectively. All experiments were performed twice a day for 3 days. The wound healing was assayed in stained histological sections in immunohistochemical of the wounds. CD68 expression was investigated under a microscope. RESULTS: The results showed that the cream from the 10% and 15% latex of J. curcas revealed moderate immune reaction to CD68 on wound healing. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the latex cream of J. curcas possesses anti-inflammatory activity in wound healing process of mice skin.
30147263 | Angiogenesis activity of Jatropha curcas L. latex in cream formulation on wound healing in mice. AIM: The aim of this research was to determine the angiogenesis activity of Jatropha curcas latex in cream formulation on CD34 immune expression during wound healing phase in mice skin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Amount of 36 2-month-old male mice were used between 30 and 40 g. To surgical procedures, wound skin incision was performed 2.0 cm in length until subcutaneous on the paravertebral of each animal. The treatment was carried under locally anesthetized with procaine cream. All mice were divided into four groups, namely the base cream as control group (A), sulfadiazine 0.1% cream (B), Jatropha curcas latex cream 10% (C), and J. curcas latex cream 15% (D). All groups were treated entire surface of wound. All experiments were performed twice a day for 10 days. Experiments were terminated on days 3, 7, and 10, respectively. The wound healing was assayed in stained histological section in immunohistochemical of the wounds. The CD34 expression was investigated under a microscope. RESULTS: The results showed that the cream from 10% and 15% latex J. curcas revealed moderate immune reaction to CD34 on days 3 and 7 in wound healing of mice skin. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the cream from 10% and 15% latex J. curcas has potential as angiogenesis activity in wound healing of mice skin.
30176234 | IL-6 is required for protective immune responses against early filarial infection. IL-6 has a wide range of biological activities that includes anti- and pro-inflammatory aspects. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-6 in immune responses to the rodent filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis, a model for human filarial infections. IL-6-/- mice had a significantly increased worm burden after natural infection compared with wild type controls at early time points p.i. Given that the worm burden in IL-6-/- mice was already increased at the time point the infective larvae reached the pleural cavity, immune responses that may facilitate the migration from the site of infection (skin) via the lymphatics to the pleural cavity were analysed. Increased vascular permeability may facilitate larval migration, but blocking of histamine receptors had no effect on worm burden and vascular permeability was similar between IL-6-/- mice and wild type controls. In contrast, blocking mast cell degranulation reduced the worm burden in IL-6-/- mice partially, suggesting that release of mast cell-derived mediators improves larval migration to some degree. Protective immune responses within the skin were involved, as bypassing the skin barrier by inoculating infective L3s subcutaneously resulted in a comparable worm recovery in both mouse strains. Analysis of the cellular composition by flow cytometry and PCR array in the skin after exposure to filarial extract or L3s, respectively, indicate that the absence of IL-6 results in a delayed recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the site of initial infection. These results demonstrate that IL-6 is essentially involved in protective immune responses within the skin that impair migration of infective L3s.
31827564 | Effect of Carica papaya Extract toward Incised Wound Healing Process in Mice (Mus musculus) Clinically and Histologically. Wound healing entails a sequence of complex biological processes, which is a protective function of the body that focuses on a quick recovery. Reducing wound healing time is crucial in a wound as it lowers the chance of infection and decreases complications and costs. Papaya extract was obtained by a maceration method. It contains papain enzyme, flavonoid, saponin, and alkaloid, which act as an anti-inflammatory, astringent substance, vasodilator, antioxidant, analgesic, with antifungal, and antibacterial properties, and increase the collagen synthesis. This study aimed to assess the effect of Carica papaya extract application toward incised wound healing process in mice (Mus musculus) clinically and histologically. This experimental laboratory study was performed using 24 mice weighing between 30 and 40 grams and 12 and 14 weeks of age as experimental animals. Each group was incised along 5 mm at the labial gingiva under both of mandible anterior teeth with a depth reaching alveolar bone. Papaya extract was applied topically in the morning and evening for 14 days. The clinical result was obtained by assessing the length of wound closure measured every day for 14 days. Based on the statistic test result, it showed that the papaya extract has a significant effect (p <= 0.05) toward the healing process of an incised oral wound in mice. Histologically at day 14, 75% concentration papaya extract showed perfect epithelial layer and fibrillation.
32148672 | The effect of zinc supplementation on pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 AND IL-6) in mice with Escherichia coli LPS-induced diarrhea. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Inflammation in the intestine causes diarrhea due to an increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6. These are triggered by the exposure of E. coli-LPS to epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa as well as low concentration of zinc in plasma such as in infants or children who are experiencing diarrhea. This paper aims to determine the effects of zinc supplementation on pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6) in mice with E. coli-LPS-induced diarrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a controlled trial experimental design in the laboratory. A sample size of 20 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: 1) Control group was given standard foods, 2) Trial group was given E. coli-LPS 2.5 mg/kg/oral once on day1, 3) Prevention group was given E. coli-LPS + 30 mg/kg/oral of zinc once daily for 12 days, 4) Therapeutic group was given E. coli-LPS, and were then given 30 mg/kg/oral of zinc once daily for 12 days if diarrhea occurred. Blood samples of mice were taken through the orbital sinus on the 0, 5th, 10th hour, and on the 4th, 8th and 12th days. RESULTS: Positive effects of zinc supplementation on levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed, in which the higher levels of zinc were present, the lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-alpha were observed. However, there was an increase of IL-1 and IL-6 levels on the 8th day in the prevention and therapeutic groups. CONCLUSION: Oral zinc supplementation had a significant positive effect on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Where there were higher levels of zinc, lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha were present.
32848324 | Malacca leaf ethanolic extract (Phyllanthus emblica) as a hepatoprotector of the liver of mice (Mus musculus) infected with Plasmodium berghei. BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although existing research confirms the antiparasitic effect of the Malacca plant against Plasmodium, its effect on the liver, one of the target organs of Plasmodium has not been investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the potential of the ethanolic extract of Malacca (Phyllanthus emblica) leaves in preventing liver damage in mice (Mus musculus) caused by Plasmodium berghei infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted using the livers of 18 mice fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. A completely randomized design with a unidirectional pattern comprising six treatments was used in this study, with each treatment consisting of three replications. Treatment 0 was the negative control group infected with P. berghei, treatment 1 was the positive control group infected with P. berghei followed by chloroquine administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg BW, and treatments 2, 3, 4, and 5 were groups infected with P. berghei and administered Malacca leaf ethanolic extracts at doses of 100, 300, 600, and 1200 mg/kg BW, respectively. The extracts were administered orally using a gastric tube for 4 consecutive days. Mice were sacrificed on the 7th day and livers were collected for histopathological examination. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the livers of mice infected with P. berghei demonstrated the presence of hemosiderin, hydropic degeneration, fat degeneration, necrosis, and megalocytosis. However, all these histopathological changes were reduced in the livers of P. berghei-infected mice treated with various doses of Malacca leaf ethanolic extract. The differences between the treatments were found be statistically significant (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Ethanolic extract of Malacca leaves has the potential to protect against liver damage in mice infected with P. berghei. The dose of 600 mg/kg BW was found to be the most effective compared with the doses of 100, 300, and 1200 mg/kg BW.
33288353 | Phytochemical characteristics from Phaleria macrocarpa and its inhibitory activity on the peritoneal damage of endometriosis. BACKGROUND: Endometriois represents a gynecological disease that still becomes an issue in community. Phaleria macrocarpa is a plant native to Indonesia that contains an antioxidant substance, which may serve as apoptotic modulator and useful for angiogenesis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effects of flavonoid isolates from P. macrocarpa (PM) on the development of granulomas, apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Total thirty mice (Mus musculus) were categorized into six groups, including the normal group (without any treatment), EMT (endometriosis) group, and EMT group treated with PM flavonoid isolates. Identification of the active compounds of P. macrocarpa was done using LC-HRMS. Measurement of granuloma scores and vascular density was done histologically. Apoptosis and proliferation analysis was performed by immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: There was an increase in granulomas, proliferation, and apoptosis in the peritoneal tissues of the endometriosis model. This change can be normalized by extract of P. macrocarpa. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the flavonoid isolates from P. macrocarpa can suppress the growth of endometriosis lesions through normalization of proliferation and apoptosis. Thus, the P. macrocarpa flavonoid can be used as an alternative to inhibit the development of endometriosis.
34616396 | SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus Spike Protein-Induced Apoptosis, Inflammatory, and Oxidative Stress Responses in THP-1-Like-Macrophages: Potential Role of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (Perindopril). A purified spike (S) glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus was used to study its effects on THP-1 macrophages, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and HUVEC cells. The S protein mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells through binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We measured the viability, intracellular cytokine release, oxidative stress, proinflammatory markers, and THP-1-like macrophage polarization. We observed an increase in apoptosis, ROS generation, MCP-1, and intracellular calcium expression in the THP-1 macrophages. Stimulation with the S protein polarizes the THP-1 macrophages towards proinflammatory futures with an increase in the TNFalpha and MHC-II M1-like phenotype markers. Treating the cells with an ACE inhibitor, perindopril, at 100 microM reduced apoptosis, ROS, and MHC-II expression induced by S protein. We analyzed the sensitivity of the HUVEC cells after the exposure to a conditioned media (CM) of THP-1 macrophages stimulated with the S protein. The CM induced endothelial cell apoptosis and MCP-1 expression. Treatment with perindopril reduced these effects. However, the direct stimulation of the HUVEC cells with the S protein, slightly increased HIF1alpha and MCP-1 expression, which was significantly increased by the ACE inhibitor treatment. The S protein stimulation induced ROS generation and changed the mitogenic responses of the PBMCs through the upregulation of TNFalpha and interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine expression. These effects were reduced by the perindopril (100 microM) treatment. Proteomic analysis of the S protein stimulated THP-1 macrophages with or without perindopril (100 microM) exposed more than 400 differentially regulated proteins. Our results provide a mechanistic analysis suggesting that the blood and vascular components could be activated directly through S protein systemically present in the circulation and that the activation of the local renin angiotensin system may be partially involved in this process. Graphical: Suggested pathways that might be involved at least in part in S protein inducing activation of inflammatory markers (red narrow) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) modulation of this process (green narrow).
35157849 | SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF8 is secreted extracellularly as a glycoprotein homodimer. ORF8 is an accessory protein encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Consensus regarding the biological functions of ORF8 is lacking, largely because the fundamental characteristics of this protein in cells have not been determined. To clarify these features, we herein established an ORF8 expression system in 293T cells. Using this system, approximately 41% of the ORF8 expressed in 293T cells were secreted extracellularly as a glycoprotein homodimer with inter/intramolecular disulfide bonds. Intracellular ORF8 was sensitive to the glycosidase Endo H, whereas the secreted portion was Endo-H-resistant, suggesting that secretion occurs via a conventional pathway. Additionally, immunoblotting analysis showed that the total amounts of the major histocompatibility complex class Iota (MHC-I), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and SARS-CoV-2 spike (CoV-2 S) proteins coexpressed in cells were not changed by the increased ORF8 expression, although FACS analysis revealed that the expression of the cell surface MHC-I protein, but not that of ACE2 and CoV-2 S proteins, was reduced by ORF8 expression. Finally, we demonstrate by RNA-seq analysis that ORF8 had no significant stimulatory effects in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). Taken together, our results provide fundamental evidence that the ORF8 glycoprotein acts as a secreted homodimer, and its functions are likely associated with the intracellular transport and/or extracellular signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
35241825 | Genome-wide analysis provides genetic evidence that ACE2 influences COVID-19 risk and yields risk scores associated with severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters human host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, through a genome-wide association study, we identify a variant (rs190509934, minor allele frequency 0.2-2%) that downregulates ACE2 expression by 37% (P = 2.7 x 10-8) and reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 40% (odds ratio = 0.60, P = 4.5 x 10-13), providing human genetic evidence that ACE2 expression levels influence COVID-19 risk. We also replicate the associations of six previously reported risk variants, of which four were further associated with worse outcomes in individuals infected with the virus (in/near LZTFL1, MHC, DPP9 and IFNAR2). Lastly, we show that common variants define a risk score that is strongly associated with severe disease among cases and modestly improves the prediction of disease severity relative to demographic and clinical factors alone.
35665465 | In silico SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development for Omicron strain using reverse vaccinology. BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic began in 2019 but it remains as a serious threat today. To reduce and prevent spread of the virus, multiple vaccines have been developed. Despite the efforts in developing vaccines, Omicron strain of the virus has recently been designated as a variant of concern (VOC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). OBJECTIVE: To develop a vaccine candidate against Omicron strain (B.1.1.529, BA.1) of the SARS-CoV-19. METHODS: We applied reverse vaccinology methods for BA.1 and BA.2 as the vaccine target and a control, respectively. First, we predicted MHC I, MHC II and B cell epitopes based on their viral genome sequences. Second, after estimation of antigenicity, allergenicity and toxicity, a vaccine construct was assembled and tested for physicochemical properties and solubility. Third, AlphaFold2, RaptorX and RoseTTAfold servers were used to predict secondary structures and 3D structures of the vaccine construct. Fourth, molecular docking analysis was performed to test binding of our construct with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Lastly, we compared mutation profiles on the epitopes between BA.1, BA.2, and wild type to estimate the efficacy of the vaccine. RESULTS: We collected a total of 10 MHC I, 9 MHC II and 5 B cell epitopes for the final vaccine construct for Omicron strain. All epitopes were predicted to be antigenic, non-allergenic and non-toxic. The construct was estimated to have proper stability and solubility. The best modelled tertiary structures were selected for molecular docking analysis with ACE2 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the potential efficacy of our newly developed vaccine construct as a novel vaccine candidate against Omicron strain of the coronavirus.
35911854 | The effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the inflammatory response in a mouse model of endometriosis: An experimental study. Background: Endometriosis pathogenesis is related to the inflammation shown by the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators. This hypoxia condition can stimulate this condition. Objective: To investigate the effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on the inflammation reaction of endometriosis-induced mice. Materials and Methods: The animals were designated into 3 groups: I) the pre-test group, II) the post-test group receiving the HBOT, and III) the post-test group without HBOT. All groups were subjected to induction of endometriosis by xenotransplantation for 15 days. HBOT was given 30 min 3 times a day for 10 days. The evaluation of the HBOT effect was conducted by examining the endometrial tissue. The inflammation level was evaluated using the Klopfleisch semiquantitative scoring system (index remmele scale), whilst the expression of nuclear factor kappa (NF kappa B) beta was measured by immunohistochemical staining. Results: The results showed that group I demonstrated the highest level of inflammation degree (9.41 +- 1.99) compared to the post-test groups (group II: 1.60 +- 0.53; group III: 2.42 +- 0.53). The HBOT-groups was found to have the lowest inflammation level compared to the non-HBOT group (p = 0.020). The results demonstrated that HBOT lowered the peritoneal inflammation degree caused by the endometrial lesion in mice. NF kappa B expression on the post-test groups was significantly decreased, compared to the pre-test group (p <= 0.001), with a strong correlation between the NF kappa B expression and the peritoneal inflammation level (p <= 0.001, r = 0.670). Conclusion: HBOT significantly reduced the inflammation level on the endometrial lesion in mice, involving the NF kappa B pathway.
35967323 | Human surfactant protein D facilitates SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype binding and entry in DC-SIGN expressing cells, and downregulates spike protein induced inflammation. Lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) are pathogen recognising C-type lectin receptors. SP-D has a crucial immune function in detecting and clearing pulmonary pathogens; DC-SIGN is involved in facilitating dendritic cell interaction with naive T cells to mount an anti-viral immune response. SP-D and DC-SIGN have been shown to interact with various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped RNA virus that causes COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) comprising of alpha-helical neck region, carbohydrate recognition domain, and eight N-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats has been shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing viral entry in Vero cells and HEK293T cells expressing ACE2. DC-SIGN has also been shown to act as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 independent of ACE2. Since rfhSP-D is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN, this study was aimed at investigating the potential of rfhSP-D in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coincubation of rfhSP-D with Spike protein improved the Spike Protein: DC-SIGN interaction. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that rfhSP-D stabilised the interaction between DC-SIGN and Spike protein. Cell binding analysis with DC-SIGN expressing HEK 293T and THP- 1 cells and rfhSP-D treated SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotypes confirmed the increased binding. Furthermore, infection assays using the pseudotypes revealed their increased uptake by DC-SIGN expressing cells. The immunomodulatory effect of rfhSP-D on the DC-SIGN: Spike protein interaction on DC-SIGN expressing epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines was also assessed by measuring the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines. RT-qPCR analysis showed that rfhSP-D treatment downregulated the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IL-1beta, IL- 6, IL-8, and RANTES (as well as NF-kappaB) in DC-SIGN expressing cells challenged by Spike protein. Furthermore, rfhSP-D treatment was found to downregulate the mRNA levels of MHC class II in DC expressing THP-1 when compared to the untreated controls. We conclude that rfhSP-D helps stabilise the interaction between SARS- CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN and increases viral uptake by macrophages via DC-SIGN, suggesting an additional role for rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
35990651 | Exploring whole proteome to contrive multi-epitope-based vaccine for NeoCoV: An immunoinformtics and in-silico approach. Neo-Coronavirus (NeoCoV) is a novel Betacoronavirus (beta-CoVs or Beta-CoVs) discovered in bat specimens in South Africa during 2011. The viral sequence is highly similar to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, particularly that of structural proteins. Thus, scientists have emphasized the threat posed by NeoCoV associated with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) usage, which could lead to a high death rate and faster transmission rate in humans. The development of a NeoCoV vaccine could provide a promising option for the future control of the virus in case of human infection. In silico predictions can decrease the number of experiments required, making the immunoinformatics approaches cost-effective and convenient. Herein, with the aid of immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology, we aimed to formulate a multi-epitope vaccine that may be used to prevent and treat NeoCoV infection. Based on the NeoCoV proteins, B-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes were shortlisted. Four vaccines (Neo-1-4) were devised by fusing shortlisted epitopes with appropriate adjuvants and linkers. The secondary and three-dimensional structures of final vaccines were then predicted. The binding interactions of these potential vaccines with toll-like immune receptors (TLR-2, TLR-3, and TLR-4) and major histocompatibility complex molecules (MHC-I and II) reveal that they properly fit into the receptors' binding domains. Besides, Neo-1 and Neo-4 vaccines exhibited better docking energies of -101.08 kcal/mol and -114.47 kcal/mol, respectively, with TLR-3 as compared to other vaccine constructs. The constructed vaccines are highly antigenic, non-allergenic, soluble, non-toxic, and topologically assessable with good physiochemical characteristics. Codon optimization and in-silico cloning confirmed efficient expression of the designed vaccines in Escherichia coli strain K12. In-silico immune simulation indicated that Neo-1 and Neo-4 vaccines could induce a strong immune response against NeoCoV. Lastly, the binding stability and strong binding affinity of Neo-1 and Neo-4 with TLR-3 receptor were validated using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations (Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area method). The final vaccines require experimental validation to establish their safety and effectiveness in preventing NeoCoV infections.
36528874 | Engineered probiotics Clostridium butyricum-pMTL007-GLP-1 improves blood pressure via producing GLP-1 and modulating gut microbiota in spontaneous hypertension rat models. Hypertension is a significant risk factor of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) with high prevalence worldwide, the current treatment has multiple adverse effects and requires continuous administration. The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have shown great potential in treating diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, obesity and hypertension. Butyric acid is a potential target in treating hypertension. Yet, the application of GLP-1 analogue and butyric acid in reducing blood pressure and reversing ventricular hypertrophy remains untapped. In this study, we combined the therapeutic capability of GLP-1 and butyric acid by transforming Clostridium butyricum (CB) with recombinant plasmid pMTL007 encoded with hGLP gene to construct the engineered probiotics Clostridium butyricum-pMTL007-GLP-1 (CB-GLP-1). We used spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) models to evaluate the positive effect of this strain in treating hypertension. The results revealed that the intragastric administration of CB-GLP-1 had markedly reduced blood pressure and improved cardiac marker ACE2, AT2R, AT1R, ANP, BNP, beta-MHC, alpha-SMA and activating AMPK/mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 signalling pathway. The high-throughput sequencing further demonstrated that CB-GLP-1 treatments significantly improved the dysbiosis in the SHR rats via downregulating the relative abundance of Porphyromonadaceae at the family level and upregulating Lactobacillus at the genus level. Hence, we concluded that the CB-GLP-1 greatly improves blood pressure and cardiomegaly by restoring the gut microbiome and reducing ventricular hypertrophy in rat models. This is the first time using engineered CB in treating hypertension, which provides a new idea for the clinical treatment of hypertension.
36576175 | Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 omicron variants from Iran and evaluation of the effect of mutations on the spike, nucleocapsid, ORF8, and ORF9b proteins function. The SARS-CoV-2 'Omicron' strain, with 15 mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD), was detected in South Africa and rapidly spread worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 ORF9b protein by binding to the TOM70 receptor and ORF8 protein by binding to MHC-I, IF3 receptors inhibit the host's immune response. In this study, genomics variations were evaluated for 96 samples isolated from Iran from March to July 2022 using the Nextclade web server and informatics tools. We identified the mutations occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We also evaluated the effect of mutations on spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor, ORF9b protein interaction with the TOM70 receptor, and structural stability of ORF8 and nucleocapsid proteins using docking and molecular dynamics. Results indicated that during March and April 2022, the BA.2 strain was dominant in the south of Iran, while during June 2022, the BA.5 strain was dominant. BF.5 strain had the most divergence among SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from south of Iran. The binding affinity of BA.5 and BF.5 strains spike protein to ACE2 receptor is similar, and compared to BA.2 strain, was stronger. The BF.5 ORF9b K40R mutation causes a better binding affinity of the protein to the TOM70 receptor. Also, mutations that occurred in the ORF8 protein led to instability in the dimer formation of this protein and improved immune response for mutations that occurred in BA.2 strain, while this mutation did not occur in BF.5 strain. The mutations that were detected in nucleocapsid protein CTD and NTD domains caused the stability of these domains.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
36609701 | The role of S477N mutation in the molecular behavior of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: An in-silico perspective. The attachment of SARA-CoV-2 happens between ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. Mutations in this domain can affect the binding affinity of the spike protein for ACE2. S477N, one of the most common mutations reported in the recent variants, is located in the RBD. Today's computational approaches in biology, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, assist researchers in predicting a protein's behavior in contact with other proteins in more detail. In this study, we investigated the interactions of the S477N-hACE2 in silico to find the impact of this mutation on its binding affinity for ACE2 and immunity responses using dynamics simulation, protein-protein docking, and immunoinformatics methods. Our computational analysis revealed an increased binding affinity of N477 for ACE2. Four new hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds in the mutant RBD-ACE2 were formed (with S19 and Q24 of ACE2), which do not exist in the wild type. Also, the protein spike structure in this mutation was associated with an increase in stabilization and a decrease in its fluctuations at the atomic level. N477 mutation can be considered as the cause of increased escape from the immune system through MHC-II.
36644779 | Cross-variant proof predictive vaccine design based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using immunoinformatics approach. Background: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is evolving continuously. The omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has the highest mutation in its spike protein, thus making the presently available vaccine ineffective or reducing its efficiency. Furthermore, the majority of the vaccines are constructed using a spike protein sequence from wild-type SARS-CoV-2. This raises the possibility of the virus evolving to the point where the vaccine's effectiveness is completely lost, even after booster doses. The study aims to develop a predictive vaccine as well as the epitopes for the updating of the vaccine sequences of currently available vaccines. In this study, following the immunoinformatics approach, predictive vaccine construction was done with the help of epitopes present on spike proteins of wild-type, delta, and omicron variants that encompass the majority of variants and possible new variants that arise from the combination of circulating variants. Results: The vaccine that was constructed was stable and immunogenic. The vaccine was constructed with the help of 18 B-cell epitopes, 5 MHC class I epitopes, and 6 MHC class II epitopes. The epitope conservancy analysis suggests that the vaccine will work for the previously known variant of concern. The vaccine bound to TLR4, TLR2, B-cell receptor chains A and B, and ACE2 receptors with a z score of - 1.4, - 1.7, - 1.4, - 1.7, and - 1.4, respectively, with a cluster size of 121 highest for the ACE2 receptor and 46 lowest for B-cell receptor chain A. The C-ImmSim simulation results indicate that the vaccine is generating both humoral and cell-mediated responses at a sufficient level throughout the month upon injection of the vaccine as an antigen. Conclusion: The study's findings indicate that the vaccine was both stable and immunogenic, providing a sufficient level of immunity. Following experimental validation, the vaccine can be used, and the epitopes can be employed for therapeutic purposes such as antibody synthesis.

36685569 | Immunoinformatics design of B and T-cell epitope-based SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccination. SARS-COV-2 is a virulent respiratory virus, first identified in China (Wuhan) at the end of 2019. Scientists and researchers are trying to find any possible solution to this deadly viral disease. Different drug source agents have been identified, including western medicine, natural products, and traditional Chinese medicine. They have the potential to counteract COVID-19. This virus immediately affects the liver and causes a decrease in oxygen levels. In this study, multiple vacciome approaches were employed for designing a multi-epitope subunit vaccine for battling against SARS-COV-2. Vaccine designing, immunogenicity, allergenic, and physico-chemical assessment were performed by using the vacciome approach. The vaccine design is likely to be antigenic and produce potent interactions with ACE2 and NSP3 receptors. The developed vaccine has also been given to in-silico cloning models and immune response predictions. A total number of 12 CTL and 12 HTL antigenic epitopes were predicted from three selected covid-19 virulent proteins (spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and membrane proteins, respectively) based on C-terminal cleavage and MHC binding scores. These predicted epitopes were amalgamated by AYY and GPGPG linkers, and a beta-defensins adjuvant was inserted into the N-terminus of this vaccine. This analysis shows that the recommended vaccine can produce immune responses against SARS-COV-2. Designing and developing of the mentioned vaccine will require further experimental validation.
36718139 | The role of HLA genotypes in understanding the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused human tragedy through the global spread of the viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2. Although the underlying factors for the severity of COVID-19 in different people are still unknown, several gene variants can be used as predictors of disease severity, particularly variations in viral receptor genes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The reaction of the immune system, as the most important defense strategy in the case of viruses, plays a decisive role. The innate immune system is important both as a primary line of defense and as a trigger of the acquired immune response. The HLA-mediated acquired immune response is linked to the acquired immune system. In various diseases, it has been shown that genetic alterations in components of the immune system can play a crucial role in how the body responds to pathogens, especially viruses. One of the most important host genetic factors is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) profile, which includes HLA classes I and II and may be symbolic of the diversity of immune response and genetic predisposition in disease progression. COVID-19 will have direct contact with the acquired immune system as an intracellular pathogen after exposure to the proteasome and its components through class I HLA. Therefore, it is assumed that in different genotypes of the HLA-I class, an undesirable supply causes an insufficient activation of the immune system. Insufficient binding of antigen delivered by class I HLA to host lymphocytes results in uncertain identification and insufficient activation of the acquired immune system. The absence of secretion of immune cytokines such as interferons, which play an important role in controlling viral infection in the early stages, is a complication of this event. Understanding the allelic diversity of HLA in people infected with coronavirus compared with uninfected people of one race not only allows identification of people with HLA susceptible to COVID-19 but also provides better insight into the behavior of the virus, which helps to take effective preventive and curative measures earlier.
36796002 | SARS-CoV-2 Variant-Specific mRNA Vaccine: Pros and Cons. Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have raised concerns about the efficacy of vaccines. The present study aimed to compare the potential of Delta and Omicron variant-specific mRNA vaccines in inducing immune responses. B cell and T cell epitopes and population coverage of spike (S) glycoprotein of the variants were predicted using the Immune Epitope Database. The molecular docking was carried out between the protein and different toll-like receptors, as well as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein and angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor using ClusPro. The molecular simulation was done for each docked RBD-ACE2 using YASARA. The mRNA secondary structure was predicted through the RNAfold. The simulation of immune responses to the mRNA vaccine construct was performed using C-ImmSim. Apart from a few positions, no significant difference was observed in the prediction of S protein B cell and T cell epitopes of these two variants. The lower amounts of Median consensus percentile in the Delta variant in similar positions signify its stronger affinity to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II binding alleles. Docking of Delta S protein with TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 and also its RBD with ACE2 showed striking interactions with the lower binding energy than Omicron. In the immune simulation, elevated levels of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes, and memory cells in both the active and resting states and the main regulators of the immune system suggested the capacity of mRNA constructs to elicit robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Considering slight differences in the binding affinity to MHC II binding alleles, activation of TLRs, mRNA secondary structure stability, and concentration of immunoglobulins and cytokines, the Delta variant is suggested for the mRNA vaccine construction. Further studies are being done to prove the efficiency of the design construct.
37080384 | Mice Humanized for MHC and hACE2 with High Permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Replication. Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) is the major receptor enabling host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with Spike. The murine ACE2 does not interact efficiently with SARS-CoV-2 Spike and therefore the laboratory mouse strains are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we generated new hACE2 transgenic mice, which harbor the hACE2 gene under the human keratin 18 promoter, in \HHD-DR1\ background. HHD-DR1 mice are fully devoid of murine Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules of class-I and -II and express only MHC molecules from Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) HLA 02.01, DRA01.01, DRB1.01.01 alleles, widely expressed in human populations. We selected three transgenic strains, with various hACE2 mRNA expression levels and distinctive profiles of lung and/or brain permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 replication. These new hACE2 transgenic strains display high permissiveness to the replication of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron sub-variants, while the previously available B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice have been reported to be poorly susceptible to infection with Omicron. As a first application, one of these MHC- and ACE2-humanized strains was successfully used to show the efficacy of a lentiviral-based COVID-19 vaccine.
37114047 | DNA immunization with in silico predicted T-cell epitopes protects against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused significant social and economic disruption worldwide, despite highly effective vaccines being developed at an unprecedented speed. Because the first licensed vaccines target only single B-cell antigens, antigenic drift could lead to loss of efficacy against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Improving B-cell vaccines by including multiple T-cell epitopes could solve this problem. Here, we show that in silico predicted MHC class I/II ligands induce robust T-cell responses and protect against severe disease in genetically modified K18-hACE2/BL6 mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
37198208 | A novel insight on SARS-CoV-2 S-derived fragments in the control of the host immunity. Despite all efforts to combat the pandemic of COVID-19, we are still living with high numbers of infected persons, an overburdened health care system, and the lack of an effective and definitive treatment. Understanding the pathophysiology of the disease is crucial for the development of new technologies and therapies for the best clinical management of patients. Since the manipulation of the whole virus requires a structure with an adequate level of biosafety, the development of alternative technologies, such as the synthesis of peptides from viral proteins, is a possible solution to circumvent this problem. In addition, the use and validation of animal models is of extreme importance to screen new drugs and to compress the organism's response to the disease. Peptides derived from recombinant S protein from SARS-CoV-2 were synthesized and validated by in silico, in vitro and in vivo methodologies. Macrophages and neutrophils were challenged with the peptides and the production of inflammatory mediators and activation profile were evaluated. These peptides were also inoculated into the swim bladder of transgenic zebrafish larvae at 6 days post fertilization (dpf) to mimic the inflammatory process triggered by the virus, which was evaluated by confocal microscopy. In addition, toxicity and oxidative stress assays were also developed. In silico and molecular dynamics assays revealed that the peptides bind to the ACE2 receptor stably and interact with receptors and adhesion molecules, such as MHC and TCR, from humans and zebrafish. Macrophages stimulated with one of the peptides showed increased production of NO, TNF-alpha and CXCL2. Inoculation of the peptides in zebrafish larvae triggered an inflammatory process marked by macrophage recruitment and increased mortality, as well as histopathological changes, similarly to what is observed in individuals with COVID-19. The use of peptides is a valuable alternative for the study of host immune response in the context of COVID-19. The use of zebrafish as an animal model also proved to be appropriate and effective in evaluating the inflammatory process, comparable to humans.
37709229 | Effects of the glycosylation of the receptor binding domain (RBD dimer)-based Covid-19 vaccine (ZF2001) on its humoral immunogenicity and immunoreactivity. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is a key target for the development of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and vaccines, mediates the binding of the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenicity of RBD-based vaccines (Ye et al., 2021). Here, our data suggested that the glycosylation significantly affected the humoral immunogenicity and immunoreactivity of the RBD-dimer-based Covid-19 vaccine (ZF2001) (Yang et al., 2021). Several deglycosylated types of ZF2001 (with sialic acid removed (ZF2001-DeltaSA), sialic acid & O-glycans removed (ZF2001-DeltaSA&O), N-glycans removed (ZF2001-DeltaN), N- & O-glycans removed (ZF2001-DeltaN&O)) were obtained by treatment with glycosidases. The binding affinity between deglycosylated types of ZF2001 and ACE2 was slightly weakened and that between deglycosylated types of ZF2001 and several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were also changed compared with ZF2001. The results of pseudovirus neutralization assay and binding affinity assay of all ZF2001 types revealed that the antigens with complex glycosylation had better humoral immunogenicity and immunoreactivity. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the more complex glycosylation of RBD corresponded to more hydrogen bonds formed between helper T-cell epitopes of RBD and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II). In summary, these results demonstrated that the glycosylation of RBD affects antigen presentation, humoral immunogenicity and immunoreactivity, which may be an important consideration for vaccine design and production technology.
38112612 | Angiotensin-(1-7) improves skeletal muscle regeneration. Skeletal muscle possesses regenerative potential via satellite cells, compromised in muscular dystrophies leading to fibrosis and fat infiltration. Angiotensin II (Ang-II) is commonly associated with pathological states. In contrast, Angiotensin (1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] counters Ang-II, acting via the Mas receptor. While Ang-II affects skeletal muscle regeneration, the influence of Ang-(1-7) remains to be elucidated. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the role of Ang-(1-7) in skeletal muscle regeneration. C2C12 cells were differentiated in the absence or presence of 10 nM of Ang-(1-7). The diameter of myotubes and protein levels of myogenin and myosin heavy chain (MHC) were determined. C57BL/6 WT male mice 16-18 weeks old) were randomly assigned to injury-vehicle, injury-Ang-(1-7), and control groups. Ang-(1-7) was administered via osmotic pumps, and muscle injury was induced by injecting barium chloride to assess muscle regeneration through histological analyses. Moreover, embryonic myosin (eMHC) and myogenin protein levels were evaluated. C2C12 myotubes incubated with Ang-(1-7) showed larger diameters than the untreated group and increased myogenin and MHC protein levels during differentiation. Ang-(1-7) administration enhances regeneration by promoting a larger diameter of new muscle fibers. Furthermore, higher numbers of eMHC (+) fibers were observed in the injured-Ang-(1-7), which also had a larger diameter. Moreover, eMHC and myogenin protein levels were elevated, supporting enhanced regeneration due to Ang-(1-7) administration. Ang-(1-7) effectively promotes differentiation in vitroand improves muscle regeneration in the context of injuries, with potential implications for treating muscle-related disorders.
38304042 | Genistein Ameliorated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) and Estrogen Receptor-Alpha (ER-alpha) in Endometriosis Mice Model, In Vivo and In Silico. Endometriosis (EM) is a gynecological disorder that causes morbidity in women and is characterized by endometrial tissue in the uterus cavity. This study investigated the mechanism of genistein in the VEGF-A and ER-alpha expression through in vivo and in silico approaches. An in vivo study was conducted by thirty-six mice that were divided into six groups including control, EM, and EM treatment with genistein with the doses of 1.3, 1.95, 2.6, and 3.25 mg/day for 14 days. Peritoneal tissues with lesions were collected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry to measure the VEGF-A and ER-alpha expression. The data were analyzed using a statistical approach using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD test with a significant value p < 0.05. In silico study was conducted for investigating the inhibition mechanism of genistein in VEGF-A and ER-alpha protein. Genistein significantly reduced the VEGF-A and ER-alpha expression with the optimum dose of 3.25 mg/day. Molecular docking showed that genistein inhibited VEGF-A in several active site residues of VEGF-A, also blocked the ER-alpha protein in estradiol binding sites. This study concluded that genistein prevented endometriosis by performing the antiangiogenic activity and showed a similar function to estradiol.
38488938 | Generation of a humanized mAce2 and a conditional hACE2 mouse models permissive to SARS-COV-2 infection. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a public health concern and a subject of active research effort. Development of pre-clinical animal models is critical to study viral-host interaction, tissue tropism, disease mechanisms, therapeutic approaches, and long-term sequelae of infection. Here, we report two mouse models for studying SARS-CoV-2: A knock-in mAce2F83Y,H353K mouse that expresses a mouse-human hybrid form of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor under the endogenous mouse Ace2 promoter, and a Rosa26 conditional knock-in mouse carrying the human ACE2 allele (Rosa26hACE2). Although the mAce2F83Y,H353K mice were susceptible to intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, they did not show gross phenotypic abnormalities. Next, we generated a Rosa26hACE2;CMV-Cre mouse line that ubiquitously expresses the human ACE2 receptor. By day 3 post infection with SARS-CoV-2, Rosa26hACE2;CMV-Cre mice showed significant weight loss, a variable degree of alveolar wall thickening and reduced survival rates. Viral load measurements confirmed inoculation in lung and brain tissues of infected Rosa26hACE2;CMV-Cre mice. The phenotypic spectrum displayed by our different mouse models translates to the broad range of clinical symptoms seen in the human patients and can serve as a resource for the community to model and explore both treatment strategies and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
38496411 | Physics-driven structural docking and protein language models accelerate antibody screening and design for broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. Therapeutic antibodies have become one of the most influential therapeutics in modern medicine to fight against infectious pathogens, cancer, and many other diseases. However, experimental screening for highly efficacious targeting antibodies is labor-intensive and of high cost, which is exacerbated by evolving antigen targets under selective pressure such as fast-mutating viral variants. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a machine learning-assisted antibody generation pipeline that greatly accelerates the screening and re-design of immunoglobulins G (IgGs) against a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus variant strains. These viruses infect human host cells via the viral spike protein binding to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using over 1300 IgG sequences derived from convalescent patient B cells that bind with spike's receptor binding domain (RBD), we first established protein structural docking models in assessing the RBD-IgG-ACE2 interaction interfaces and predicting the virus-neutralizing activity of each IgG with a confidence score. Additionally, employing Gaussian process regression (also known as Kriging) in a latent space of an antibody language model, we predicted the landscape of IgGs' activity profiles against individual coronaviral variants of concern. With functional analyses and experimental validations, we efficiently prioritized IgG candidates for neutralizing a broad spectrum of viral variants (wildtype, Delta, and Omicron) to prevent the infection of host cells in vitro and hACE2 transgenic mice in vivo . Furthermore, the computational analyses enabled rational redesigns of selective IgG clones with single amino acid substitutions at the RBD-binding interface to improve the IgG blockade efficacy for one of the severe, therapy-resistant strains - Delta (B.1.617). Our work expedites applications of artificial intelligence in antibody screening and re-design even in low-data regimes combining protein language models and Kriging for antibody sequence analysis, activity prediction, and efficacy improvement, in synergy with physics-driven protein docking models for antibody-antigen interface structure analyses and functional optimization.
38496880 | Untargeted metabolomics uncovers metabolic dysregulation and tissue sensitivity in ACE2 knockout mice. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) polymorphisms are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity and dyslipidemia, which have been determined in various populations. Consistently, ACE2 knockout (ACE2 KO) mice display damaged energy metabolism in multiple tissues, especially the key metabolic tissues such as liver, skeletal muscle and epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and show even more severe phenotype under high-fat diet (HFD) induced metabolic stress. However, the effects of ACE2 on global metabolomics profiling and the tissue sensitivity remain unclear. To understand how tissues independently and collectively respond to ACE2, we performed untargeted metabolomics in serum in ACE2 KO and control wild type (WT) mice both on normal diet (ND) and HFD, and in three key metabolic tissues (liver, skeletal muscle and eWAT) after HFD treatment. The results showed significant alterations in metabolic profiling in ACE2 KO mice. We identified 275 and 168 serum metabolites differing significantly between WT and ACE2 KO mice fed on ND and HFD, respectively. And the altered metabolites in the ACE2 KO group varied from 90 to 196 in liver, muscle and eWAT. The alterations in ND and HFD serum were most similar. Compared with WT mice, ACE2 KO mice showed an increase in N-phenylacetylglutamine (PAGln), methyl indole-3-acetate, 5-hydroxytryptophol, cholic acid, deoxycholic acid and 12(S)-HETE, while LPC (19:0) and LPE (16:1) decreased. Moreover, LPC (20:0), LPC (20:1) and PC (14:0e/6:0) were reduced in both ND and HFD serum, paralleling the decreases identified in HFD skeletal muscle. Interestingly, DL-tryptophan, indole and Gly-Phe decreased in both ND and HFD serum but were elevated in HFD liver of ACE2 KO mice. A low level of l-ergothioneine was observed among liver, muscle, and epididymal fat tissue of ACE2 KO mice. Pathway analysis demonstrated that different tissues exhibited different dysregulated metabolic pathways. In conclusion, these results revealed that ACE2 deficiency leads to an overall state of metabolic distress, which may provide a new insight into the underlying pathogenesis in metabolic disorders in both ACE2 KO mice and in patients with certain genetic variant of ACE2 gene.
38498345 | Candesartan upregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in kidneys of male animals by decreased ubiquitination. Candesartan is a common angiotensin-II receptor-1 blocker used for patients with cardiovascular and renal diseases. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a negative regulator of blood pressure (BP), and also a major receptor for coronaviruses. To determine whether and how candesartan upregulates ACE2, we examined BP and ACE2 in multi-organs from male and female C57BL/6J mice treated with candesartan (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 days. Relative to the vehicle, candesartan lowered BP more in males than females; ACE2 protein abundances were increased in kidneys, not lungs, hearts, aorta, liver, spleen, brain, or serum, only from males. Ace2-mRNA was similar in kidneys. Candesartan also decreased BP in normal, hypertensive, and nephrotic male rats. The renal ACE2 was increased by the drug in normal and nephrotic male rats but not spontaneously hypertensive ones. In male mouse kidneys, ACE2 was distributed at sodium-hydrogen-exchanger-3 positive proximal-convoluted-tubules; ACE2-ubiquitination was decreased by candesartan, accompanied with increased ubiquitin-specific-protease-48 (USP48). In candesartan-treated mouse renal proximal-convoluted-tubule cells, ACE2 abundances and activities were increased while ACE2-ubiquitination and colocalization with lysosomal and proteosomal markers were decreased. The silence of USP48 by siRNA caused a reduction of ACE2 in the cells. Thus, the sex-differential ACE2 upregulation by candesartan in kidney from males may be due to the decreased ACE2-ubiquitination, associated with USP48, and consequent degradation in lysosomes and proteosomes. This is a novel mechanism and may shed light on candesartan-like-drug choice in men and women prone to coronavirus infections.
38532242 | ACE2 Rescues Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy by Reducing Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Neuronal Apoptosis via the Nrf2/Sestrin2 Signaling Pathway. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the progression of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is considered to be a neuroprotective factor due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, the role of ACE2 on myeloid cells in regulating SAE and the underlying mechanism warrants further exploration. SAE was induced in ACE2 transgenic (TG), knockout (KO), and bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The expression levels of apoptosis-, oxidation- and neuroinflammation-associated mediators and morphological changes were monitored by quantitative real-time PCR analyses and histological examinations in the cortex of septic mice. The contents of angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang-(1-7) along with the activity of ACE2 were examined with commercial kits. The expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Sestrin2 was detected by immunoblotting analysis. Our results indicated that the expression of cortical ACE2 was significantly reduced in the early phase of CLP-induced sepsis. Moreover, ACE2 overexpression in TG mice conferred neuroprotection against sepsis, as evidenced by alleviated neuronal apoptosis, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory M1-like microglial polarization, accompanied by upregulation of the Ang-(1-7), Nrf2, and Sestrin2 protein levels. Conversely, ACE2 deficiency in KO mice exacerbated SAE. The neuroprotective effects of ACE2 were further confirmed in wild-type mice transplanted with ACE2-TG and KO BM cells. Therefore, our data suggest that myeloid ACE2 exerts a protective role in the pathogenesis of SAE, potentially by activating Ang-(1-7)-Nrf2/sestrin2 signaling pathway, and highlight that upregulating ACE2 expression and activity may represent a promising approach for the treatment of SAE in patients with sepsis.
38553607 | Preclinical evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor RAY1216 shows improved pharmacokinetics compared with nirmatrelvir. Although vaccines are available for SARS-CoV-2, antiviral drugs such as nirmatrelvir are still needed, particularly for individuals in whom vaccines are less effective, such as the immunocompromised, to prevent severe COVID-19. Here we report an alpha-ketoamide-based peptidomimetic inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), designated RAY1216. Enzyme inhibition kinetic analysis shows that RAY1216 has an inhibition constant of 8.4 nM and suggests that it dissociates about 12 times slower from Mpro compared with nirmatrelvir. The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro:RAY1216 complex shows that RAY1216 covalently binds to the catalytic Cys145 through the alpha-ketoamide group. In vitro and using human ACE2 transgenic mouse models, RAY1216 shows antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants comparable to those of nirmatrelvir. It also shows improved pharmacokinetics in mice and rats, suggesting that RAY1216 could be used without ritonavir, which is co-administered with nirmatrelvir. RAY1216 has been approved as a single-component drug named 'leritrelvir' for COVID-19 treatment in China.
38562613 | Lipid Nanoparticle-Based Inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 Host Cell Infection. Purpose: The global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the lingering threat to public health has fueled the search for effective therapeutics to treat SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to develop lipid nanoparticle (LNP) inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry to reduce viral infection in the nose and upper airway. Methods: Two types of LNP formulations were prepared following a microfluidic mixing method. The LNP-Trap consisted of DOPC, DSPC, cholesterol, and DSPE-PEG-COOH modified with various spike protein binding ligands, including ACE2 peptide, recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) or monoclonal antibody to spike protein (mAb). The LNP-Trim consisted of ionizing cationic DLin-MC3-DMA, DSPC, cholesterol, and DMG-PEG lipids encapsulating siACE2 or siTMPRSS2. Both formulations were assayed for biocompatibility and cell uptake in airway epithelial cells (Calu-3). Functional assessment of activity was performed using SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding assays (LNP-Trap), host receptor knockdown (LNP-Trim), and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay (LNP-Trap and LNP-Trim). Localization and tissue distribution of fluorescently labeled LNP formulations were assessed in mice following intranasal administration. Results: Both LNP formulations were biocompatible based on cell impedance and MTT cytotoxicity studies in Calu-3 cells at concentrations as high as 1 mg/mL. LNP-Trap formulations were able to bind spike protein and inhibit pseudovirus infection by 90% in Calu-3 cells. LNP-Trim formulations reduced ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the mRNA (70% reduction) and protein level (50% reduction). The suppression of host targets in Calu-3 cells treated with LNP-Trim resulted in over 90% inhibition of pseudovirus infection. In vivo studies demonstrated substantial retention of LNP-Trap and LNP-Trim in the nasal cavity following nasal administration with minimal systemic exposure. Conclusion: Both LNP-Trap and LNP-Trim formulations were able to safely and effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection in airway epithelial cells. These studies provide proof-of-principle for a localized treatment approach for SARS-CoV-2 in the upper airway.
38598560 | SARS-CoV-2 infects cells lining the blood-retinal barrier and induces a hyperinflammatory immune response in the retina via systemic exposure. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to cause wide-ranging ocular abnormalities and vision impairment in COVID-19 patients. However, there is limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 in ocular transmission, tropism, and associated pathologies. The presence of viral RNA in corneal/conjunctival tissue and tears, along with the evidence of viral entry receptors on the ocular surface, has led to speculation that the eye may serve as a potential route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here, we investigated the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with cells lining the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and the role of the eye in its transmission and tropism. The results from our study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 ocular exposure does not cause lung infection and moribund illness in K18-hACE2 mice despite the extended presence of viral remnants in various ocular tissues. In contrast, intranasal exposure not only resulted in SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein presence in different ocular tissues but also induces a hyperinflammatory immune response in the retina. Additionally, the long-term exposure to viral S-protein caused microaneurysm, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) mottling, retinal atrophy, and vein occlusion in mouse eyes. Notably, cells lining the BRB, the outer barrier, RPE, and the inner barrier, retinal vascular endothelium, were highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Unexpectedly, primary human corneal epithelial cells were comparatively resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cells lining the BRB showed induced expression of viral entry receptors and increased susceptibility towards SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death. Furthermore, hyperglycemic conditions enhanced the viral entry receptor expression, infectivity, and susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death in the BRB cells, confirming the reported heightened pathological manifestations in comorbid populations. Collectively, our study provides the first evidence of SARS-CoV-2 ocular tropism via cells lining the BRB and that the virus can infect the retina via systemic permeation and induce retinal inflammation.
38624231 | NS7a of SADS-CoV promotes viral infection via inducing apoptosis to suppress type III interferon production. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a newly discovered swine coronavirus with potential cross-species transmission risk. Although SADS-CoV-induced host cell apoptosis and innate immunity antagonization has been revealed, underlying signaling pathways remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that infection of SADS-CoV induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro, and that viral protein NS7a is mainly responsible for SADS-CoV-induced apoptosis in host cells. Furthermore, we found that NS7a interacted with apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1) to activate caspase-3 via caspase-6 in SADS-CoV-infected cells, and enhanced SADS-CoV replication. Importantly, NS7a suppressed poly(I:C)-induced expression of type III interferon (IFN-lambda) via activating caspase-3 to cleave interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and caspase-3 inhibitor protects piglets against SADS-CoV infection in vivo. These findings reveal how SADS-CoV induced apoptosis to inhibit innate immunity and provide a valuable clue to the development of effective drugs for the clinical control of SADS-CoV infection.IMPORTANCEOver the last 20 years, multiple animal-originated coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2, have caused millions of deaths, seriously jeopardized human health, and hindered social development, indicating that the study of animal-originated coronaviruses with potential for cross-species transmission is particularly important. Bat-originated swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), discovered in 2017, can not only cause fatal diarrhea in piglets, but also infect multiple human cells, with a potential risk of cross-species transmission, but its pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that NS7a of SADS-CoV suppresses IFN-lambda production via apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1)-caspase-6-caspase-3-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway, and caspase-3 inhibitor (Z-DEVD-FMK) can effectively inhibit SADS-CoV replication and protect infected piglets. Our findings in this study contribute to a better understanding of SADS-CoV-host interactions as a part of the coronaviruses pathogenesis and using apoptosis-inhibitor as a drug as potential therapeutic approaches for prevention and control of SADS-CoV infection.
38626093 | Peak transgene expression after intramuscular immunization of mice with adenovirus 26-based vector vaccines correlates with transgene-specific adaptive immune responses. Non-replicating adenovirus-based vectors have been broadly used for the development of prophylactic vaccines in humans and are licensed for COVID-19 and Ebola virus disease prevention. Adenovirus-based vectored vaccines encode for one or more disease specific transgenes with the aim to induce protective immunity against the target disease. The magnitude and duration of transgene expression of adenovirus 5- based vectors (human type C) in the host are key factors influencing antigen presentation and adaptive immune responses. Here we characterize the magnitude, duration, and organ biodistribution of transgene expression after single intramuscular administration of adenovirus 26-based vector vaccines in mice and evaluate the differences with adenovirus 5-based vector vaccine to understand if this is universally applicable across serotypes. We demonstrate a correlation between peak transgene expression early after adenovirus 26-based vaccination and transgene-specific cellular and humoral immune responses for a model antigen and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, independent of innate immune activation. Notably, the memory immune response was similar in mice immunized with adenovirus 26-based vaccine and adenovirus 5-based vaccine, despite the latter inducing a higher peak of transgene expression early after immunization and a longer duration of transgene expression. Together these results provide further insights into the mode of action of adenovirus 26-based vector vaccines.
38636395 | Intratumoural delivery of TRAIL mRNA induces colon cancer cell apoptosis. Novel strategies in intratumoral injection and emerging immunotherapies have heralded a new era of precise cancer treatments. The affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors, a feature which facilitates virulent human infection, is leveraged in this research. Colon cancer cells, with their high ACE2 expression, provide a potentially strategic target for using this SARS-CoV-2 feature. While the highly expression of ACE2 is observed in several cancer types, the idea of using the viral spike protein for targeting colon cancer cells offers a novel approach in cancer treatment. Intratumoral delivery of nucleic acid-based drugs is a promising alternative to overcoming the limitations of existing therapies. The increasing importance of nucleic acids in this realm, and the use of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) for local delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, are important breakthroughs. LNPs protect nucleic acid drugs from degradation and enhance cellular uptake, making them a rapidly evolving nano delivery system with high precision and adaptability. Our study leveraged a tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) combined with a receptor-binding domain from the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, encapsulated in LNPs, to target colon cancer cells. Our results indicated that the TRAIL fusion-mRNA induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings highlight LNP-encapsulated TRAIL fusion-mRNA as a potential colon cancer therapy.
38637878 | Enhancement of NETosis by ACE2-cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in patients with COVID-19. BACKGROUND: High levels of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation or NETosis and autoantibodies are related to poor prognosis and disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cross-reactive anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 RBD) antibodies (CR Abs) have been reported as one of the sources of anti-ACE2 autoantibodies. However, the pathological implications of CR Abs in NET formation remain unknown. METHODS: In this study, we first assessed the presence of CR Abs in the sera of COVID-19 patients with different severity by serological analysis. Sera and purified IgG from CR Abs positive COVID-19 patients as well as a mouse monoclonal Ab (mAb 127) that can recognize both ACE2 and the RBD were tested for their influence on NETosis and the possible mechanisms involved were studied. RESULTS: An association between CR Abs levels and the severity of COVID-19 in 120 patients was found. The CR Abs-positive sera and IgG from severe COVID-19 patients and mAb 127 significantly activated human leukocytes and triggered NETosis, in the presence of RBD. This NETosis, triggered by the coexistence of CR Abs and RBD, activated thrombus-related cells but was abolished when the interaction between CR Abs and ACE2 or Fc receptors was disrupted. We also revealed that CR Abs-induced NETosis was suppressed in the presence of recombinant ACE2 or the Src family kinase inhibitor, dasatinib. Furthermore, we found that COVID-19 vaccination not only reduced COVID-19 severity but also prevented the production of CR Abs after SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide possible pathogenic effects of CR Abs in exacerbating COVID-19 by enhancing NETosis, highlighting ACE2 and dasatinib as potential treatments, and supporting the benefit of vaccination in reducing disease severity and CR Abs production in COVID-19 patients.
38640424 | Discovery of common molecular signatures and drug repurposing for COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity: ACE2 and multi-partite networks. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the ongoing global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to elucidate potential therapeutic avenues by scrutinizing approved drugs through the identification of the genetic signature associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with asthma. This exploration was conducted through an integrated analysis, encompassing interaction networks between the ACE2 receptor and common host (co-host) factors implicated in COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. The comprehensive analysis involved the identification of common differentially expressed genes (cDEGs) and hub-cDEGs, functional annotations, interaction networks, gene set variation analysis (GSVA), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and module construction. Interaction networks were used to identify overlapping disease modules and potential drug targets. Computational biology and molecular docking analyzes were utilized to discern functional drug modules. Subsequently, the impact of the identified drugs on the expression of hub-cDEGs was experimentally validated using a mouse model. A total of 153 cDEGs or co-host factors associated with ACE2 were identified in the COVID-19 and asthma comorbidity. Among these, seven significant cDEGs and proteins - namely, HRAS, IFNG, JUN, CDH1, TLR4, ICAM1, and SCD-were recognized as pivotal host factors linked to ACE2. Regulatory network analysis of hub-cDEGs revealed eight top-ranked transcription factors (TFs) proteins and nine microRNAs as key regulatory factors operating at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively. Molecular docking simulations led to the proposal of 10 top-ranked repurposable drug molecules (Rapamycin, Ivermectin, Everolimus, Quercetin, Estradiol, Entrectinib, Nilotinib, Conivaptan, Radotinib, and Venetoclax) as potential treatment options for COVID-19 in individuals with comorbid asthma. Validation analysis demonstrated that Rapamycin effectively inhibited ICAM1 expression in the HDM-stimulated mice group (p < 0.01). This study unveils the common pathogenesis and genetic signature underlying asthma and SARS-CoV-2 infection, delineated by the interaction networks of ACE2-related host factors. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and discovery of drugs aimed at more effective therapeutics within the context of lung disease comorbidities.
38646531 | Identification and characterization of endogenous retroviruses upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) derived from the long terminal repeat (LTR) family of transposons constitute a significant portion of the mammalian genome, with origins tracing back to ancient viral infections. Despite comprising approximately 8% of the human genome, the specific role of ERVs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains unclear. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide identification of ERVs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) and primary lung epithelial cells from monkeys and mice, both infected and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2. We identified 405, 283, and 206 significantly up-regulated transposable elements (TEs) in hPBMCs, monkeys, and mice, respectively. This included 254, 119, 68, and 28 ERVs found in hPBMCs from severe and mild COVID-19 patients, monkeys, and transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2) and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, analysis using the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) revealed certain parental genomic sequences of these up-regulated ERVs in COVID-19 patients may be involved in various biological processes, including histone modification and viral replication. Of particular interest, we identified 210 ERVs specifically up-regulated in the severe COVID-19 group. The genes associated with these differentially expressed ERVs were enriched in processes such as immune response activation and histone modification. HERV1_I-int: ERV1:LTR and LTR7Y: ERV1:LTR were highlighted as potential biomarkers for evaluating the severity of COVID-19. Additionally, validation of our findings using RT-qPCR in Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) from mice infected by HSV-1 and VSV provided further support to our results. This study offers insights into the expression patterns and potential roles of ERVs following viral infection, providing a valuable resource for future studies on ERVs and their interaction with SARS-CoV-2.
38149392 | [miR-509-3p promotes oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced apoptosis in mouse aortic endothelial cells]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of microRNA-509-3p (miR-509-3p) on the apoptosis of atherosclerotic vascular endothelial cells. METHODS: Mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) were divided into normal control group, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) group, miR-509-3p overexpression group, miR-509-3p overexpression control group, miR-509-3p inhibitor + ox-LDL group, and miR-509-3p inhibitor control + ox-LDL group. MAEC were induced with 100 mg/L ox-LDL for 24 hours, and then transfected with miR-509-3p overexpression/inhibitor and corresponding control for 48 hours. The miR-509-3p expression in MAECs exposed to ox-LDL was detected using real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Flow cytometry was used to detect the level of apoptosis, and cell counting kit (CCK-8) was used to detect the proliferation activity of MAECs. The direct gene targets of miR-509-3p were predicted using bioinformatics analyses and confirmed using a dual luciferase reporter assay. The expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein was detected by RT-qPCR and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, miR-509-3p was significantly upregulated in ox-LDL-stimulated MAECs (1.68+-0.85 vs. 1.00+-0.30, t = 2.398, P < 0.05). After transfection of MAECs with miR-509-3p overexpression, the luciferase activity of the BCL2 3'UTR WT reporter gene was significantly lower than that of miR-509-3p overexpression control group (0.83+-0.06 vs. 1.00+-0.07, t = 4.531, P = 0.001). The luciferase activity of the BCL2 3'-UTR mutant (MUT) reporter gene was not significantly different from that of miR-509-3p overexpression control group (0.94+-0.05 vs. 1.00+-0.08, t = 1.414, P = 0.188). Compared with the normal control group and miR-509-3p mimics control group, the cell proliferation activity was decreased [(0.60+-0.06)% vs. (1.00+-0.09)%, (0.89+-0.04)%, both P < 0.01], the percentage of apoptotic cells were increased [(23.46+-2.02)% vs. (7.66+-1.52)%, (10.40+-0.78)%, both P < 0.05], and the mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 were significantly downregulated (Bcl-2 mRNA: 0.52+-0.13 vs. 1.00+-0.36, 1.10+-0.19, Bcl-2 protein: 0.42+-0.07 vs. 1.00+-0.11, 0.93+-0.10, both P < 0.01) in miR-509-3p overexpression group. Compared with the ox-LDL group, inhibition of miR-509-3p expression could increase the proliferation activity of MAECs induced by ox-LDL [(0.64+-0.35)% vs. (0.34+-0.20%)%, P < 0.05], and reduce the apoptosis rate [(13.59+-2.22)% vs. (29.84+-5.19)%, P < 0.01], and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein in MAECs induced by ox-LDL (Bcl-2 mRNA relative expression: 0.82+-0.09 vs. 0.52+-0.10, Bcl-2 protein relative expression: 0.83+-0.17 vs. 0.40+-0.07, both P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 was one of the target genes of miR-509-3p. miR-509-3p can reduce the proliferation activity of endothelial cells, reduce the expression of Bcl-2, and promote cell apoptosis, thereby promoting the occurrence and development of atherosclerosis. Inhibition of miR-509-3p expression may be a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis.
38190032 | Prenatal double-hit with aluminium and cadmium mediate testicular atrophy and hypothalamic hypoplasia: the role of oxido-nitrergic stress and endocrine perturbations. There is limited experimental evidence on the biochemical consequences of aluminium (Al) and cadmium (Cd) co-exposures during pregnancy and postnatal life.This study investigated the impacts of perinatal Al chloride (AlCl3) and Cd chloride (CdCl2) co-exposures on neuroendocrine functions in mice offspring during postnatal life. The study comprised of four pregnant experimental groups. Group 1 received AlCl3 (10 mg/kg), group 2 were administered CdCl2 (1.5 mg/kg), while group 3 received both AlCl3 (10 mg/kg) and CdCl2 (1.5 mg/kg) (AlCl3+CdCl2), and group 4 received saline (10 mL/kg) only and served as control group. All experimental animals were chemically exposed once daily from gestation days 7-20. Upon delivery, male pups were regrouped based on maternal chemical exposure on postnatal day 21 (PND 21) and allowed to grow to adulthood until PND 78, after which they were sacrificed for assessment of neuroendocrine markers and histological investigations. There was no statistical significance (p > 0.05) on follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, estrogen and progesterone, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine (T4) in all treatment groups relative to controls . However, AlCl3 and AlCl3-CdCl2 significantly (p < 0.05) reduced triiodothyronine (T3) levels, with a profound increase in T3:T4 ratio by AlCl3, and AlCl3+CdCl2 compared to control. Furthermore, pups from pregnant mice treated with CdCl2 and AlCl3+CdCl2 demonstrated increased testicular malondialdehyde concentration with increased catalase activity relative to controls, suggesting oxidative imbalance. In addition, AlCl3, CdCl2, and AlCl3+CdCl2 exposures induced testicular and hypothalamic architectural disruption compared to controls, with marked architectural derangement in the AlCl3+CdCl2 group. Our findings suggest that prenatal co-exposures to Alcl3 and CdCl2 induce testicular and hypothalamic alterations in offspring via a testicular oxidative stress and thyrotoxicosis-dependent mechanisms.
38271814 | The hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is intact in male insulin receptor substrate 4 knockout mice. OBJECTIVE: Loss of function mutations in the insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) gene cause a rare form of X-linked congenital central hypothyroidism in boys and men. Affected individuals show decreased thyroid-stimulation hormone (TSH) secretion. Members of the IRS family canonically act as scaffold proteins between tyrosine kinase receptors and downstream effectors. How loss of IRS4 affects TSH synthesis or secretion is unresolved. We therefore assessed IRS4's role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis of Irs4 knockout mice. METHODS: We generated two global Irs4 knockout mouse lines harboring either two or four base-pair deletions that result in frameshifts and loss of most of the IRS4 protein. RESULTS: Under normal laboratory conditions, Irs4 knockout males did not exhibit impairments in pituitary expression of TSH subunit genes (Tshb or Cga) or in the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor. Additionally, their serum thyroid hormone, T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), and hypothalamic Trh expression levels were normal. When Irs4 knockouts were rendered hypothyroid with a low-iodine diet supplemented with propylthiouracil (PTU) for 3 weeks, their serum TSH increased similarly to wild-type males. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Irs4 knockout mice do not exhibit central hypothyroidism or otherwise appear to phenocopy IRS4 deficient patients. Compensation by another IRS protein may explain euthyroidism in these animals.
38316794 | Resolvin T4 enhances macrophage cholesterol efflux to reduce vascular disease. While cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major co-morbidities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the mechanism(s) that contribute to CVD in patients with RA remain to be fully elucidated. Herein, we observe that plasma concentrations of 13-series resolvin (RvT)4 negatively correlate with vascular lipid load in mouse inflammatory arthritis. Administration of RvT4 to male arthritic mice fed an atherogenic diet significantly reduces atherosclerosis. Assessment of the mechanisms elicited by this mediator demonstrates that RvT4 activates cholesterol efflux in lipid laden macrophages via a Scavenger Receptor class B type 1 (SR-BI)-Neutral Cholesterol Ester Hydrolase-dependent pathway. This leads to the reprogramming of lipid laden macrophages yielding tissue protection. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of macrophage SR-BI reverses the vasculo-protective activities of RvT4 in vitro and in male mice in vivo. Together these findings elucidate a RvT4-SR-BI centered mechanism that orchestrates macrophage responses to limit atherosclerosis during inflammatory arthritis.
38340425 | Overexpression of ABCC1 and ABCG2 confers resistance to talazoparib, a poly (ADP-Ribose) polymerase inhibitor. AIMS: The overexpression of ABC transporters on cancer cell membranes is one of the most common causes of multidrug resistance (MDR). This study investigates the impact of ABCC1 and ABCG2 on the resistance to talazoparib (BMN-673), a potent poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, in ovarian cancer treatment. METHODS: The cell viability test was used to indicate the effect of talazoparib in different cell lines. Computational molecular docking analysis was conducted to simulate the interaction between talazoparib and ABCC1 or ABCG2. The mechanism of talazoparib resistance was investigated by constructing talazoparib-resistant subline A2780/T4 from A2780 through drug selection with gradually increasing talazoparib concentration. RESULTS: Talazoparib cytotoxicity decreased in drug-selected or gene-transfected cell lines overexpressing ABCC1 or ABCG2 but can be restored by ABCC1 or ABCG2 inhibitors. Talazoparib competitively inhibited substrate drug efflux activity of ABCC1 or ABCG2. Upregulated ABCC1 and ABCG2 protein expression on the plasma membrane of A2780/T4 cells enhances resistance to other substrate drugs, which could be overcome by the knockout of either gene. In vivo experiments confirmed the retention of drug-resistant characteristics in tumor xenograft mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic efficacy of talazoparib in cancer may be compromised by its susceptibility to MDR, which is attributed to its interactions with the ABCC1 or ABCG2 transporters. The overexpression of these transporters can potentially diminish the therapeutic impact of talazoparib in cancer treatment.
38345223 | T4 Bacteriophage and E. coli Interaction in the Murine Intestine: A Prototypical Model for Studying Host-Bacteriophage Dynamics In Vivo. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect bacteria with species- and strain-level specificity and are the most abundant biological entities across all known ecosystems. Within bacterial communities, such as those found in the gut microbiota, phages are implicated in regulating microbiota population dynamics and driving bacterial evolution. There has been renewed interest in phage research in the last decade, in part due to the host-specific killing capabilities of lytic phages, which offer a promising tool to counter the increasing threat of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrating that phages adhere to intestinal mucus suggest they may have a protective role in preventing bacterial invasion into the underlying epithelium. Importantly, like bacterial microbiomes, disrupted phageomes have been associated with worsened outcomes in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. Previous studies have demonstrated that phages can modulate the microbiome of animals and humans through fecal filtrate transplants, benefiting the host's health. With this recent wave of research comes the necessity to establish and standardize protocols for studying phages in the context of the gut microbiome. This protocol provides a set of procedures to study isolated T4 phages and their bacterial host, Escherichia coli, in the context of the murine gastrointestinal tract. The methods described here outline how to start from a phage lysate, administer it to mice and assess effects on bacterial host and phage levels. This protocol can be modified and applied to other phage-bacterial pairs and provides a starting point for studying host-phage dynamics in vivo.
38373365 | New synthetic molecules incorporated into polymeric micelles used for treatment against visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) presents problems, mainly related to drug toxicity, high cost and/or by emergence of resistant strains. In the present study, two vanillin synthetic derivatives, 3 s [4-(2-hydroxy-3-(4-octyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)propoxy)-3-methoxybenzaldehyde] and 3 t [4-(3-(4-decyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropoxy)-3-methoxybenzaldehyde], were evaluated as therapeutic candidates in a murine model against Leishmania infantum infection. Molecules were used pure (3 s and 3 t) or incorporated into Poloxamer 407-based micelles (3 s/M and 3 t/M) in the infected animals, which also received amphotericin B (AmpB) or Ambisome  as control. Results showed that 3 s/M and 3 t/M compositions induced a Th1-type immune response in treated animals, with higher levels of IFN-gamma, IL-2, TNF-alpha, IL-12, nitrite, and IgG2a antibodies. Animals presented also low toxicity and significant reductions in the parasite load in their spleens, livers, bone marrows and draining lymph nodes, as compared as control groups mice, with the evaluations performed one and 30 days after the application of the therapeutics. In conclusion, preliminary data suggest that 3 s/M and 3 t/M could be considered for future studies as therapeutic agents against VL.
38423410 | Effective substances and molecular mechanisms guided by network pharmacology: An example study of Scrophulariae Radix treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone-induced liver and kidney injuries. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Scrophulariae Radix (Xuanshen [XS]) has been used for several years to treat hyperthyroidism. However, its effective substances and pharmacological mechanisms in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone-induced liver and kidney injuries have not yet been elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to explore the pharmacological material basis and potential mechanism of XS therapy for hyperthyroidism and thyroid hormone-induced liver and kidney injuries based on network pharmacology prediction and experimental validation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on 31 in vivo XS compounds identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem quadruple exactive orbitrap high-resolution accurate-mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE-HRMS), a network pharmacology approach was used for mechanism prediction. Systematic networks were constructed to identify the potential molecular targets, biological processes (BP), and signaling pathways. A component-target-pathway network was established. Mice were administered levothyroxine sodium through gavage for 30 d and then treated with different doses of XS extract with or without propylthiouracil (PTU) for 30 d. Blood, liver, and kidney samples were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting. RESULTS: A total of 31 prototypes, 60 Phase I metabolites, and 23 Phase II metabolites were tentatively identified in the plasma of rats following the oral administration of XS extract. Ninety-six potential common targets between the 31 in vivo compounds and the diseases were identified. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that Bcl-2, BAD, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 were the top targets. XS extract with or without PTU had the following effects: inhibition of T3/T4/fT3/fT4 caused by levothyroxine; increase of TSH levels in serum; restoration of thyroid structure; improvement of liver and kidney structure and function by elevating the activities of anti-oxidant enzymes catalase (CAT),superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px); activation anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2; inhibition the apoptotic protein p-BAD; downregulation inflammation-related proteins p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-p38; and inhibition of the aggregation of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6, as well as immune cells in the liver. CONCLUSION: XS can be used to treat hyperthyroidism and liver and kidney injuries caused by thyroid hormones through its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. In addition, serum pharmacochemical analysis revealed that five active compounds, namely 4-methylcatechol, sugiol, eugenol, acetovanillone, and oleic acid, have diverse metabolic pathways in vivo and exhibit potential as effective therapeutic agents.
38429788 | Thyroid hormone protects human lung epithelial cells from cold preservation and warm reperfusion-induced injury. BACKGROUND: Cellular stress associated with static-cold storage (SCS) and warm reperfusion of donor lungs can contribute to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury during transplantation. Adding cytoprotective agents to the preservation solution may be conducive to reducing graft deterioration and improving post-transplant outcomes. METHODS: SCS and warm reperfusion were simulated in human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) by exposing cells to low potassium dextran glucose solution at 4  C for different periods and then switching back to serum-containing culture medium at 37  C. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore potential cytoprotective agents. Based on its results, cell viability, caspase activity, cell morphology, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory gene expression were examined under simulated IR conditions with or without thyroid hormones (THs). RESULTS: After 18 h SCS followed by 2 h warm reperfusion, genes related to inflammation and cell death were upregulated, and genes related to protein synthesis and metabolism were downregulated in BEAS-2B cells, which closely mirrored gene profiles found in thyroid glands of mice with congenital hypothyroidism. The addition of THs (T3 or T4) to the preservation solution increases cell viability, inhibits activation of caspase 3, 8 and 9, preserves cell morphology, enhances mitochondrial membrane potential, reduces mitochondrial superoxide production, and suppresses inflammatory gene expression. CONCLUSION: Adding THs to lung preservation solutions may protect lung cells during SCS by promoting mitochondrial function, reducing apoptosis, and inhibiting pro-inflammatory pathways. Further in vivo testing is warranted to determine the potential clinical application of adding THs as therapeutics in lung preservation solutions.
38442663 | The hysteresis damage of cold exposure on tissue and transcript levels in mice. OBJECTIVES: Although cold stress-induced damage to the heart and thyroid has been reported, specific organ associations between the heart and thyroid with delayed injury mechanisms have not been investigated. In this study, we determined the damage time and transcript levels of a large number of genes in the heart and thyroid after cold exposure. Meanwhile, we analysed the relationship between heart and thyroid injury in human medical records to determine the association of delayed injury from cold exposure. METHODS: Mice were exposed to cold stress and hysteresis injury. Gene changes at the transcriptional level were detected using high throughput sequencing technology. The most variable genes were verified at the protein level using Western Blotting and medical records were collected and analysed. RESULTS: The damage was the most severe when the animals were allowed to recover to room temperature for 4 h after exposure to cold stress. During this process, STAT1 and ATF3 genes were acutely up-regulated. Analysis of human medical records showed the highest correlation between AST and T4 under cold stress (p = 0.0011). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to cold increases blood level of free thyroid hormone and biomarkers of myocardial injury, as well as related mRNA levels. These changes were more pronounced after return to room temperature.
38455657 | Cardiac recovery from pressure overload is not altered by thyroid hormone status in old mice. Introduction: Thyroid hormones (THs) are known to have various effects on the cardiovascular system. However, the impact of TH levels on preexisting cardiac diseases is still unclear. Pressure overload due to arterial hypertension or aortic stenosis and aging are major risk factors for the development of structural and functional abnormalities and subsequent heart failure. Here, we assessed the sensitivity to altered TH levels in aged mice with maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Methods: Mice at the age of 12 months underwent TAC and received T4 or anti-thyroid medication in drinking water over the course of 4 weeks after induction of left ventricular pressure overload. Results: T4 excess or deprivation in older mice had no or only very little impact on cardiac function (fractional shortening), cardiac remodeling (cardiac wall thickness, heart weight, cardiomyocyte size, apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis), and mortality. This is surprising because T4 excess or deprivation had significantly changed the outcome after TAC in young 8-week-old mice. Comparing the gene expression of deiodinases (Dio) 2 and 3 and TH receptor alpha (TRalpha) 1 and the dominant-negative acting isoform TRalpha2 between young and aged mice revealed that aged mice exhibited a higher expression of TRalpha2 and Dio3, while expression of Dio2 was reduced compared with young mice. These changes in Dio2 and 3 expressions might lead to reduced TH availability in the hearts of 12-month-old mice accompanied by reduced TRalpha action due to higher TRalpha2. Discussion: In summary, our study shows that low and high TH availability have little impact on cardiac function and remodeling in older mice with preexisting pressure-induced cardiac damage. This observation seems to be the result of an altered expression of deiodinases and TRalpha isoforms, thus suggesting that even though cardiovascular risk is increasing with age, the response to TH stress may be dampened in certain conditions.
38521387 | Thyroid hormone deprival and tsh/tshr signaling deficiency lead to central hypothyroidism-associated intestinal dysplasia. BACKGROUND: Central hypothyroidism (CH) is characterized by low T4 levels and reduced levels or bioactivity of circulating TSH. However, there is a lack of studies on CH-related intestinal maldevelopment. In particular, the roles of TH and TSH/TSHR signaling in CH-related intestinal maldevelopment are poorly understood. Herein, we utilized Tshr-/- mice as a congenital hypothyroidism model with TH deprival and absence of TSHR signaling. METHODS: The morphological characteristics of intestines were determined by HE staining, periodic acid-shiff staining, and immunohistochemical staining. T4 was administrated into the offspring of homozygous mice from the fourth postnatal day through weaning or administrated after weaning. RT-PCR was used to evaluate the expression of markers of goblet cells and intestinal digestive enzymes. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis was used to explore the cell types and gene profiles of metabolic alternations in early-T4-injected Tshr-/- mice. KEY FINDINGS: Tshr deletion caused significant growth retardation and intestinal maldevelopment, manifested as smaller and more slender small intestines due to reduced numbers of stem cells and differentiated epithelial cells. Thyroxin supplementation from the fourth postnatal day, but not from weaning, significantly rescued the abnormal intestinal structure and restored the decreased number of proliferating intestinal cells in crypts of Tshr-/- mice. Tshr-/- mice with early-life T4 injections had more early goblet cells and impaired metabolism compared to Tshr+/+ mice. SIGNIFICANCE: TH deprival leads to major defects of CH-associated intestinal dysplasia while TSH/TSHR signaling deficiency promotes the differentiation of goblet cells and impairs nutrition metabolism.
38548396 | [Influences and mechanism of extracellular vesicles from dermal papilla cells of mice on human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts]. Objective: To investigate the influences and mechanism of extracellular vesicles from dermal papilla cells (DPC-EVs) of mice on human hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs). Methods: The study was an experimental research. The primary dermal papilla cells (DPCs) of whiskers were extracted from 10 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice and identified successfully. The DPC-EVs were extracted from the 3rd to 5th passage DPCs by ultracentrifugation, and the morphology was observed through transmission electron microscope and the particle diameter was detected by nanoparticle tracking analyzer (n=3) at 24 h after culture. The 3rd passage of HSFs were divided into DPC-EV group and phosphate buffer solution (PBS) group, which were cultured with DPC-EVs and PBS, respectively. The cell scratch test was performed and cell migration rate at 24 h after scratching was calculated (n=5). The cell proliferation levels at 0 (after 12 h of starvation treatment and before adding DPC-EVs or PBS), 24, 48, 72, and 96 h after culture were detected by using cell counting kit 8 (n=4). The protein expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen typeI (ColI) in cells at 24 h after culture were detected by immunofluorescence method and Western blotting, and the protein expression of Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in cells at 24 h after culture was detected by Western blotting. After the 3rd passage of HSFs were cultured with DPC-EVs for 24 h, the cells were divided into blank control group, KLF4 knockdown group, and KLF4 overexpression group according to the random number table. The cells in blank control group were only routinely cultured for 48 h. The cells in KLF4 knockdown group and KLF4 overexpression group were incubated with KLF4 knockdown virus for 24 h, then the cells in KLF4 knockdown group were routinely cultured for 24 h while the cells in KLF4 overexpression group were incubated with KLF4 overexpression virus for 24 h. The protein expressions of KLF4, alpha-SMA, and ColI in cells were detected by Western blotting at 48 h after culture. Results: At 24 h after culture, the extracted DPC-EVs showed vesicular structure with an average particle diameter of 108.8 nm. At 24 h after scratching, the migration rate of HSFs in PBS group was (54+-10)%, which was significantly higher than (29+-8)% in DPC-EV group (t=4.37, P<0.05). At 48, 72, and 96 h after culture, the proliferation levels of HSFs in DPC-EV group were significantly lower than those in PBS group (with t values of 4.06, 5.76, and 6.41, respectively, P<0.05). At 24 h after culture, the protein expressions of alpha-SMA and ColI of HSFs in DPC-EV group were significantly lower than those in PBS group, while the protein expression of KLF4 was significantly higher than that in PBS group. At 48 h after culture, compared with those in blank control group, the protein expression of KLF4 of HSFs in KLF4 knockdown group was down-regulated, while the protein expressions of alpha-SMA and ColI were both up-regulated; compared with those in KLF4 knockdown group, the protein expression of KLF4 of HSFs in KLF4 overexpression group was up-regulated, while the protein expressions of ColI and alpha-SMA were down-regulated. Conclusions: The DPC-EVs of mice can inhibit the proliferation and migration of human HSFs and significantly inhibit the expressions of fibrosis markers alpha-SMA and ColI in human HSFs by activating KLF4.
38548592 | [Effects of periodontitis on bone and tryptophan metabolism of gut microbiota in estrogen-deficient mice]. Objective: To study the effects of periodontitis on bone and tryptophan metabolism of gut microbiota in the context of estrogen deficiency. Methods: Thirty-two female C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into four groups based on table of random numbers (n=8 in each group): Sham group, in which mice were given sham surgery; Sham_Lig group, in which mice were given sham surgery and were induced to periodontitis by ligating the bilateral maxillary second molars with 5-0 silk threads at the fourth week; Ovx group, in which mice were given bilateral ovariectomy; Ovx_Lig group, in which mice were given bilateral ovariectomy and were induced to periodontitis at the fourth week. After 8 weeks of ligation, the mice of 4 groups were euthanized for collecting the samples of femur, tibia, mandible and skull. Those samples were scanned by micro-CT to measure the bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume versus total volume ratio (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and trabecular spacing (Tb.Sp). The cecum contents of 4 groups of mice were collected for gut microbiota 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The tryptophan and its metabolites in intestinal tracts were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the abundance of gut microbiota and the content of tryptophan and its metabolites. Results: Femur BMD [(82.23+-3.97) mg/cm3], BV/TV [(9.25+-1.37) %] and Tb.Th [(70.95+-5.70) mum] in Ovx_Lig group were significantly lower than Ovx group [(96.30+-3.76) mg/cm3 (P=0.004); (14.45+-1.55)% (P=0.022) and (87.58+-8.02) mum (P<0.001), respectively]. The beta-diversity analysis of gut microbiota based on Bray-Curtis distance showed that samples of Ovx_Lig group and Ovx group were obviously grouped. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that Alistipes was the representative genus in Ovx_Lig group. The relative abundance of Alistipes in Ovx_Lig group [(0.42+-0.14) %] were significantly higher than that in Ovx group [(0.17+-0.05) %] (t=4.45, P<0.001). Tryptophan metabolism analysis showed that the content of kynurenic acid [(531.12+-158.60) ng/g] in Ovx_Lig group were significantly higher than that in Ovx group [(400.42+-57.96) ng/g] (t=2.19, P=0.046). And the content of Indole-3-carbaldehyde [(383.37+-144.06) ng/g] in Ovx_Lig group were lower than Ovx group [(701.72+-141.93) ng/g] (t=4.45, P<0.001). Correlation analysis showed that relative abundance of Alistipes was positively correlated with kynurenic acid (r=0.32, P=0.088), while negatively correlated with indole-3-carbaldehyde (r=-0.32, P=0.088). Conclusions: Periodontitis can induce bone destruction of femur in estrogen-deficient mice, the mechanism of which may be related to Alistipes in gut and the tryptophan metabolites kynurenic acid and indole-3-carbaldehyde.
38552927 | Mitochondria-tau association promotes cognitive decline and hippocampal bioenergetic deficits during the aging. Current studies indicate that pathological modifications of tau are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic failure, and cognitive decline in neurological disorders and aging. We previously showed that caspase-3 cleaved tau, a relevant tau form in Alzheimer's disease (AD), affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, dynamics and synaptic plasticity by the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Also, genetic ablation of tau promotes mitochondrial function boost and increased cognitive capacities in aging mice. However, the mechanisms and relevance of these alterations for the cognitive and mitochondrial abnormalities during aging, which is the primary risk factor for AD, has not been explored. Therefore, in this study we used aging C57BL/6 mice (2-15 and 28-month-old) to evaluate hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance and mitochondrial function. Behavioral tests revealed that aged mice (15 and 28-month-old) showed a reduced cognitive performance compared to young mice (2 month). Concomitantly, isolated hippocampal mitochondria of aged mice showed a significant decrease in bioenergetic-related functions including increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial depolarization, ATP decreases, and calcium handling defects. Importantly, full-length and caspase-3 cleaved tau were preferentially present in mitochondrial fractions of 15 and 28-month-old mice. Also, aged mice (15 and 28-month-old) showed an increase in cyclophilin D (CypD), the principal regulator of mPTP opening, and a decrease in Opa-1 mitochondrial localization, indicating a possible defect in mitochondrial dynamics. Importantly, we corroborated these findings in immortalized cortical neurons expressing mitochondrial targeted full-length (GFP-T4-OMP25) and caspase-3 cleaved tau (GFP-T4C3-OMP25) which resulted in increased ROS levels and mitochondrial fragmentation, along with a decrease in Opa-1 protein expression. These results suggest that tau associates with mitochondria and this binding increases during aging. This connection may contribute to defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics which later may conduce to cognitive decline present during aging.
38575319 | Reduced Cortical Thickness Correlates of Cognitive Dysfunction in Post-COVID-19 Condition: Insights from a Long-Term Follow-up. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a paucity of data on long-term neuroimaging findings from individuals who have developed the post-coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) condition. Only 2 studies have investigated the correlations between cognitive assessment results and structural MR imaging in this population. This study aimed to elucidate the long-term cognitive outcomes of participants with the post-COVID-19 condition and to correlate these cognitive findings with structural MR imaging data in the post-COVID-19 condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 53 participants with the post-COVID-19 condition underwent 3T brain MR imaging with T1 and FLAIR sequences obtained a median of 1.8 years after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery was used to assess several cognitive domains in the same individuals. Correlations between cognitive domains and whole-brain voxel-based morphometry were performed. Different ROIs from FreeSurfer were used to perform the same correlations with other neuroimaging features. RESULTS: According to the Frascati criteria, more than one-half of the participants had deficits in the attentional (55%, n = 29) and executive (59%, n = 31) domains, while 40% (n = 21) had impairment in the memory domain. Only 1 participant (1.89%) showed problems in the visuospatial and visuoconstructive domains. We observed that reduced cortical thickness in the left parahippocampal region (t(48) = 2.28, P = .03) and the right caudal-middle-frontal region (t(48) = 2.20, P = .03) was positively correlated with the memory domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cognitive impairment in individuals with the post-COVID-19 condition is associated with long-term alterations in the structure of the brain. These macrostructural changes may provide insight into the nature of cognitive symptoms.
38591881 | The potentiality of bacteria to drive SARS-CoV-2 mutation. A recent study published in mBio by Cao et al. revealed the crucial roles of bacteria in benefitting SARS-CoV-2 mutations (B. Cao, X. Wang, W. Yin, Z. Gao, and B. Xia, mBio e3187-23, 2024, https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.03187-23). Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for predicting the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic and developing preventive and treatment strategies. This study provides important insights into the rapid and complex evolution of viruses facilitated by bacterial-virus interactions.
38594245 | Resistance mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro to the non-covalent inhibitor WU-04. Drug resistance poses a significant challenge in the development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we identified two double mutations, M49K/M165V and M49K/S301P, in the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) that confer resistance to a novel non-covalent inhibitor, WU-04, which is currently in phase III clinical trials (NCT06197217). Crystallographic analysis indicates that the M49K mutation destabilizes the WU-04-binding pocket, impacting the binding of WU-04 more significantly than the binding of 3CLpro substrates. The M165V mutation directly interferes with WU-04 binding. The S301P mutation, which is far from the WU-04-binding pocket, indirectly affects WU-04 binding by restricting the rotation of 3CLpro's C-terminal tail and impeding 3CLpro dimerization. We further explored 3CLpro mutations that confer resistance to two clinically used inhibitors: ensitrelvir and nirmatrelvir, and revealed a trade-off between the catalytic activity, thermostability, and drug resistance of 3CLpro. We found that mutations at the same residue (M49) can have distinct effects on the 3CLpro inhibitors, highlighting the importance of developing multiple antiviral agents with different skeletons for fighting SARS-CoV-2. These findings enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 resistance mechanisms and inform the development of effective therapeutics.
38600104 | The genomic evolutionary dynamics and global circulation patterns of respiratory syncytial virus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in young children and the second leading cause of infant death worldwide. While global circulation has been extensively studied for respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza, and more recently also in great detail for SARS-CoV-2, a lack of global multi-annual sampling of complete RSV genomes limits our understanding of RSV molecular epidemiology. Here, we capitalise on the genomic surveillance by the INFORM-RSV study and apply phylodynamic approaches to uncover how selection and neutral epidemiological processes shape RSV diversity. Using complete viral genome sequences, we show similar patterns of site-specific diversifying selection among RSVA and RSVB and recover the imprint of non-neutral epidemic processes on their genealogies. Using a phylogeographic approach, we provide evidence for air travel governing the global patterns of RSVA and RSVB spread, which results in a considerable degree of phylogenetic mixing across countries. Our findings highlight the potential of systematic global RSV genomic surveillance for transforming our understanding of global RSV spread.
38601327 | Wearable devices for remote monitoring of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Vietnam. Patients with severe COVID-19 disease require monitoring with pulse oximetry as a minimal requirement. In many low- and middle- income countries, this has been challenging due to lack of staff and equipment. Wearable pulse oximeters potentially offer an attractive means to address this need, due to their low cost, battery operability and capacity for remote monitoring. Between July and October 2021, Ho Chi Minh City experienced its first major wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to an unprecedented demand for monitoring in hospitalized patients. We assess the feasibility of a continuous remote monitoring system for patients with COVID-19 under these circumstances as we implemented 2 different systems using wearable pulse oximeter devices in a stepwise manner across 4 departments.
38613931 | A mixed-methods evaluation: COVID Care in the Home, a public health response to the first omicron wave across the Torres and Cape region, Queensland. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the COVID-19 Care in the Home (CCITH) program during the first COVID-19 omicron wave across Torres Strait and Cape York region of Far North Queensland in 2022. METHODS: A mixed-method study: An online survey and semi-structured interviews of CCITH internal and external stakeholders and participants was utilised to develop a greater understanding of perspectives of the program. RESULTS: Survey participants n=140. Most survey respondents did not attend hospital, emergency, or primary healthcare centre during isolation for medical assistance (82%, 115/140) and most strongly agreed/agreed (87%, 122/140) that the CCITH program cared for their health needs. Interview participants n=14. Thematic analysis of interviews verified survey responses and identified successes of this program including improved community relationships and primary healthcare centres and community members felt supported. Limitations included rapid changes to policies and roles and limited food availability during isolation. CONCLUSIONS: The CCITH program highlights the resilience and self-determination of First Nations communities and primary health staff across the Torres Strait and Cape York throughout the first COVID-19 outbreak in the region. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: This virtual model of care could be employed in similar settings to improve service provision in both primary and public health to increase community safety and achieve good health outcomes.
38623013 | [Clinical characteristics of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in Yunnan]. Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of 130 children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in Yunnan province after the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and analyze the risk factors for mortality. Methods: This study is a retrospective case summary that analyzed the demographic data, underlying diseases, clinical diagnoses, disease outcomes, and laboratory results of 130 children with severe COVID-19 infections admitted to nine top-tier hospitals in Yunnan Province from December 2022 to March 2023. According to the prognosis, the patients were divided into survival group and death group. The clinical and laboratory data between the two groups were compared, and the risk factors of death were evaluated. The chi2 test and Mann-Whitney U test were employed to compare between groups, while Spearman correlation test and multiple Logistic regression were used to analyze the risk factors for death. The predictive value of independent risk factors was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The 130 severe patients included 80 males and 50 females with an onset age of 28.0 (4.5, 79.5) months. There were 97 cases in the survival group and 33 cases in the death group with no significant differences in gender and age between the two groups (P>0.05). Twenty-five cases (19.2%) out of the 130 patients had underlying diseases, and the number with underlying diseases was significantly higher in death group than in survival group (36.4% (12/33) vs. 13.4%(13/97), chi2=8.36, P=0.004). The vaccination rate in the survival group was significantly higher than that in the death group (86.1% (31/36) vs. 7/17, chi2=9.38, P=0.002). A total of 42 cases (32.3%) of the 130 patients were detected to be infected with other pathogens, but there was no significant difference in the incidence of co-infection between the death group and the survival group (39.3%(13/33) vs. 29% (29/97), chi2=1.02, P>0.05). Among the 130 cases, severe respiratory cases were the most common 66 cases (50.8%), followed by neurological severe illnesses 34 cases (26.2%) and circulatory severe cases 13 cases (10%). Compared to the survival group, patients in the death group had a significantly higher levels of neutrophil, ferritin, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, B-type natriuretic peptide, interleukin-6 and 10 (6.7 (4.0, 14.0) vs. 3.0 (1.6, 7.0)x109/L, 479 (298, 594) vs. 268 (124, 424) mug/L, 4.8 (1.7, 10.6) vs. 2.0 (1.1, 3.1) mug/L, 66 (20, 258) vs. 23 (15, 49) U/L, 464 (311, 815) vs. 304 (252, 388) g/L, 71(52, 110) vs. 24(15, 48) U/L, 484 (160, 804) vs. 154 (26, 440) ng/L, 43 (23, 102) vs. 19 (13, 27) ng/L, 216 (114, 318) vs. 86 (45, 128) ng/L, Z=-4.21, -3.67, -3.76, -3.31, -3.75, -5.74, -3.55, -4.65, -5.86, all P<0.05). The correlated indexes were performed by multivariate Logistic regression and the results showed that vaccination was a protective factor from death in severe cases (OR=0.01, 95%CI 0-0.97, P=0.049) while pediatric sequential organ failure assessment (PSOFA) (OR=3.31, 95%CI 1.47-7.47, P=0.004), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR=1.56, 95%CI 1.05-2.32, P=0.029) and D dimer (OR=1.49, 95%CI 1.00-1.02, P=0.033) were independent risk factors for death (all P<0.05). The area under the curve of the three independent risk factors for predicting death were 0.86 (95%CI 0.79-0.94), 0.89 (95%CI 0.84-0.95) and 0.87 (95%CI 0.80-0.94), all P<0.001, and the cut-off values were 4.50, 3.66 and 4.69 mg/L, respectively. Conclusions: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection can occur in children of all ages, primarily affecting the respiratory system, but can also infect the nervous system, circulatory system or other systems. Children who died had more severe inflammation, tissue damage and coagulation disorders. The elevations of PSOFA, NLR and D dimer were independent risk factors for death in severe children.
38632309 | Theoretical and mathematical codynamics of nonlinear tuberculosis and COVID-19 model pertaining to fractional calculus and probabilistic approach. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus known as coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that affects the pulmonary structure and results in the coronavirus illness 2019 (COVID-19). Tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 codynamics have been documented in numerous nations. Understanding the complexities of codynamics is now critically necessary as a consequence. The aim of this research is to construct a co-infection model of TB and COVID-19 in the context of fractional calculus operators, white noise and probability density functions, employing a rigorous biological investigation. By exhibiting that the system possesses non-negative and bounded global outcomes, it is shown that the approach is both mathematically and biologically practicable. The required conditions are derived, guaranteeing the eradication of the infection. Sensitivity analysis and bifurcation of the submodel are also investigated with system parameters. Furthermore, existence and uniqueness results are established, and the configuration is tested for the existence of an ergodic stationary distribution. For discovering the system's long-term behavior, a deterministic-probabilistic technique for modeling is designed and operated in MATLAB. By employing an extensive review, we hope that the previously mentioned approach improves and leads to mitigating the two diseases and their co-infections by examining a variety of behavioral trends, such as transitions to unpredictable procedures. In addition, the piecewise differential strategies are being outlined as having promising potential for scholars in a range of contexts because they empower them to include particular characteristics across multiple time frame phases. Such formulas can be strengthened via classical technique, power-law, exponential decay, generalized Mittag-Leffler kernels, probability density functions and random procedures. Furthermore, we get an accurate description of the probability density function encircling a quasi-equilibrium point if the effect of TB and COVID-19 minimizes the propagation of the codynamics. Consequently, scholars can obtain better outcomes when analyzing facts using random perturbations by implementing these strategies for challenging issues. Random perturbations in TB and COVID-19 co-infection are crucial in controlling the spread of an epidemic whenever the suggested circulation is steady and the amount of infection eliminated is closely correlated with the random perturbation level.
38635853 | Modeling the emergence of viral resistance for SARS-CoV-2 during treatment with an anti-spike monoclonal antibody. To mitigate the loss of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency use authorization was given to several anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients with a high risk of progressing to severe disease. Monoclonal antibodies used to treat SARS-CoV-2 target the spike protein of the virus and block its ability to enter and infect target cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy can thus accelerate the decline in viral load and lower hospitalization rates among high-risk patients with variants susceptible to mAb therapy. However, viral resistance has been observed, in some cases leading to a transient viral rebound that can be as large as 3-4 orders of magnitude. As mAbs represent a proven treatment choice for SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections, evaluation of treatment-emergent mAb resistance can help uncover underlying pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may also help in the development of the next generation of mAb therapies. Although resistance can be expected, the large rebounds observed are much more difficult to explain. We hypothesize replenishment of target cells is necessary to generate the high transient viral rebound. Thus, we formulated two models with different mechanisms for target cell replenishment (homeostatic proliferation and return from an innate immune response antiviral state) and fit them to data from persons with SARS-CoV-2 treated with a mAb. We showed that both models can explain the emergence of resistant virus associated with high transient viral rebounds. We found that variations in the target cell supply rate and adaptive immunity parameters have a strong impact on the magnitude or observability of the viral rebound associated with the emergence of resistant virus. Both variations in target cell supply rate and adaptive immunity parameters may explain why only some individuals develop observable transient resistant viral rebound. Our study highlights the conditions that can lead to resistance and subsequent viral rebound in mAb treatments during acute infection.
2419435 | Immunotherapy for myasthenia gravis: a murine model. In vivo therapy with monoclonal antibody (mAb) GK1.5, which recognizes a glycoprotein antigen designated L3T4 on murine helper T lymphocytes, either prevented or suppressed the development of murine lupus, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and collagen arthritis. The L3T4 antigen in the mouse is analogous to the human Leu-3/T4 antigen expressed on helper T lymphocytes, because they both participate in the T cell response to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Class II MHC genes and I-A antigens mediate murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) induced by acetylcholine receptor (AChR) autoimmunity. We studied the efficacy of mAb GK1.5 as an immunotherapeutic agent for murine EAMG. Therapy with mAb GK1.5 not only suppressed established autoimmunity to AChR but also prevented loss of muscle AChR in mice with EAMG. Moreover, permanent remission of clinical muscle weakness was induced if mAb GK1.5 therapy was initiated after the onset of clinical disease. Because the function of the Leu-3/T4 determinant on human helper T lymphocytes is analogous to the murine L3T4 determinant, use of antibody to the Leu-3/T4 determinant as an immunotherapeutic agent may provide a way to control the progression of human MG.
2466458 | Mutagenesis of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor. To define the structure-function relationship, we have made a number of mutants of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) by in vitro mutagenesis. The results indicate that most of the mutations located in the internal and C-terminal regions of the molecule abolished the activity, whereas the mutants without N-terminal 4, 5, 7, or 11 amino acids retained the activity. N-terminal amino acids were also altered by cassette mutagenesis using a synthetic oligonucleotide mixture. Among them, KW2228, in which Thr-1, Leu-3, Gly-4, Pro-5 and Cys-17 were respectively substituted with Ala, Thr, Tyr, Arg and Ser, showed more potent granulopoietic activity than that of intact hG-CSF both in vitro and in vivo.
2936815 | An autoreactive T cell clone that can be activated to provide both helper and suppressor function. To understand further the biologic significance of the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction, we determined the functional properties of autoreactive T cell lines and clones. Initially, we found that cells in an uncloned autoreactive Leu-3+ T cell line helped immunoglobulin production when added to cultures containing fresh T and non-T cells in the absence of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) but suppressed immunoglobulin production in the same cultures in the presence of PWM. To explain this phenomenon, we studied the immunoregulatory potential of an autoreactive T cell clone termed MTC-4. This clone bore the phenotype Leu-3+, 2-, 8-, 11-, DR+ and underwent proliferation when co-cultured with autologous, but not allogeneic non-T cells. Of interest, the immunoregulatory potential of the MTC-4 cells varied according to how the cells were activated. When MTC-4 cells were cultured with autologous non-T cells in the absence of antigen or mitogen (unactivated non-T cells), polyclonal immunoglobulin production (detected by reverse PFC assay) was observed. This helper activity was MHC-restricted in that it was elicited only by autologous non-T cells or MHC-matched allogeneic non-T cells; however, once activated by autologous non-T cells, it could also help allogeneic non-T cells. In contrast, when MTC-4 cells were cultured with autologous non-T cells in the presence of PWM (activated non-T cells), immunoglobulin production was greatly suppressed. This suppression was also observed when MTC-4 cells were added to cultures containing exogenous T cell help (such as that provided by autologous fresh T cells) and was not due to a direct effect of PWM on the T cell clone, because preincubation of MTC-4 cells with PWM before culture with non-T cells did not result in suppression. On the basis of these data, we conclude that autoreactive T cells can have dual immunoregulatory function that is manifest, at least in part, at the single cell level. Moreover, these regulatory functions are differentially elicited depending on the state of activation of the stimulating autologous non-T cells: when stimulated by MHC antigens present on unactivated B cells, they provide helper activity; and when stimulated by MHC antigens present on activated B cells, they act as suppressor cells. Autoreactive T cells with dual regulatory potential appear to make up a substantial proportion of all autoreactive T cells and are cells that are uniquely adapted to maintain immunologic homeostasis.
3224036 | [Local immunotherapy with OK-432 for malignant gliomas--immunohistochemical analysis of chronological changes of tumor tissues]. Chronological changes of glioma tissues treated with local immunotherapy with OK-432 were examined by immunohistochemical method. OK-432 was injected into glioma tissues through Ommaya's reservoir 3 days (3 patients), 7 days (2 patients) and 14 days (2 patients) prior to the operation. Frozen sections surgically obtained from these patients were stained with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method using Leu-series monoclonal antibodies for pan T lymphocytes (Leu-1), cytotoxic/suppressor T lymphocytes (Leu-2 a), helper/inducer T lymphocytes (Leu-3 a), B lymphocytes (Leu-12), MHC class I antigen (beta 2m) and MHC class II antigen (HLA-DR). In 2 out of 7 glioma tissues obtained before local injection of OK-432, only few T lymphocytes were found infiltrating around the small blood vessels. In all glioma tissues obtained 3 and 7 days after injection, coagulation necrosis of glioma tissues was observed within 1-2 cm from Ommaya's tube and many T lymphocytes granulocytes and macrophages were infiltrating diffusely in the glioma tissues. Whereas in all glioma tissues obtained 14 days after injection, coagulation necrosis was also observed, however granulocytes and macrophages were scarce. The most of the infiltrating cells were T lymphocytes. Examination of T lymphocytes phenotypes revealed that both cytotoxic/suppressor and helper/inducer phenotypes of T lymphocytes were intermingled with each other in all cases. beta 2m was expressed on the most of glioma cells in all cases before and after injection. Whereas HLA-DR antigen was expressed on the tumor cells in 4 out of 7 cases before injection, however this antigen was expressed in all cases after injection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
3320179 | Expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens on bile duct epithelium in patients with hepatic graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation. We studied the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens in liver biopsies taken from ten patients with clinical and biochemical evidence of liver damage after bone marrow transplantation. In all six patients who had histologically confirmed graft-versus-host disease, MHC class II antigens were detected on intrahepatic bile ducts. In four patients with no histological features of graft-versus-host disease, MHC class II antigens were not detected. In controls, a positive reaction for bile duct MHC class II antigens was only detected in the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. Characterisation of the lymphocytes surrounding the bile ducts showed a prevalence of Leu 3+ cells in graft-versus-host disease and primary biliary cirrhosis. We propose that the aberrant expression of class II antigens on bile duct epithelium cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of graft-versus-host disease. A similar pattern in primary biliary cirrhosis may suggest a common pathogenetic mechanism.
3338094 | Cell-mediated responses and protection elicited by a carbohydrate-lipid-containing fraction extracted from Leishmania major promastigotes. Carbohydrate-lipid-containing fractions (CLF) extracted from Leishmania major promastigotes and recognized by sera from immune but not from normal human donors were evaluated for their capacity to elicit cell-mediated responses. It was found that one of these fractions, CLF-1, stimulated the in vitro response of lymphocytes from immune but not from normal human donors. A similarly extracted fraction from L. donovani parasites also elicited an in vitro response by cells from donors immune to L. major. The response was mediated by antigen-presenting cells, and specific Leu 3+ Leu 2- T cells from a human T-cell line responded to the antigen. In vivo, the CLF-1 elicited delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in L. major-immunized C3H mice, which was comparable to the DTH response elicited by freeze-thawed and sonicated L. major promastigotes. C3H mice were vaccinated with CLF-1 prior to challenge with live L. major promastigotes. Mice vaccinated with CLF-1-containing liposomes showed a significant degree of protection to challenge. These results suggest that the carbohydrate-lipid-containing fraction described here may represent a functional antigenic entity from Leishmania parasites.
3919141 | Successful treatment of autoimmunity in NZB/NZW F1 mice with monoclonal antibody to L3T4. Autoimmune NZB/NZW mice were treated with weekly injections of monoclonal antibody (mAb) to L3T4, an antigen expressed on a distinct subpopulation of T cells that respond to class II major histocompatibility antigens. Treatment with anti-L3T4 depleted circulating target cells, reduced autoantibody production, retarded renal disease, and prolonged life relative to control mice treated either with saline or with purified nonimmune rat IgG. These findings establish that autoimmune disease in NZB/NZW mice is regulated by T cells. In contrast to mice treated with nonimmune rat IgG, mice treated with rat anti-L3T4 mAb developed little or no antibody to rat Ig. Thus, the benefits of treatment with anti-L3T4 were achieved while minimizing the risks associated with a host immune response to therapy. This study raises the possibility that treatment with mAb against Leu-3/T4, the human homologue for L3T4 might be effective in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases in people.
6195255 | Evidence implicating L3T4 in class II MHC antigen reactivity; monoclonal antibody GK1.5 (anti-L3T4a) blocks class II MHC antigen-specific proliferation, release of lymphokines, and binding by cloned murine helper T lymphocyte lines. Monoclonal antibody GK1.5 recognizes a determinant, designated L3T4a, on the murine T cell surface molecule L3T4. The expression of L3T4a by functional murine T cell clones appears to correlate primarily with class II MHC antigen reactivity rather than with functional phenotype. In previous studies, antigen-specific cytolysis by a cloned class II MHC antigen(I-Ak)-reactive CTL line was found to be blocked entirely by monoclonal antibody (mAb) GK1.5, at a step before the lethal hit. In the present studies, we demonstrate that mAb GK1.5 profoundly blocks antigen-specific proliferation and release of lymphokines by cloned murine class II MHC antigen-reactive helper T lymphocyte (HTL) lines. Analysis of cloned T cell hybridomas, however, suggests that there exists clonal heterogeneity in the degree of inhibition of class II MHC antigen-specific function by mAb GK 1.5. Finally, we present evidence that mAb GK1.5 blocks class II MHC antigen-specific function by blocking class II MHC antigen-specific binding. The data presented here lend considerable support to the concept both that L3T4 and the human Leu-3/T4 molecules are similar and that L3T4 plays a role in class II MHC antigen-reactivity by murine T cells.
6198377 | Monoclonal antibody to L3T4 blocks the function of T cells specific for class 2 major histocompatibility complex antigens. The ability of antibody to Lyt-2 and to the newly described L3T4 antigen to block the functions of helper T cells with specificity for allogeneic class 1 or class 2 MHC subregion antigens was determined. Anti-Lyt-2 blocked both allohelp delivered by unprimed T cells and IL 2 production by primed T cells when the response was directed to class 1 MHC antigens, but had no effect when the response was directed to class 2 MHC or Mls antigens. Anti-L3T4 had reciprocal activity. A control reagent, anti-LFA-1, blocked all responses tested regardless of specificity. This and other reports provide strong evidence that L3T4 is the murine equivalent of the human T cell markers Leu 3/OKT4. The ability of antibodies directed against Lyt-2 and L3T4 to block T cell function in a fashion determined by the class of MHC antigen recognized by the T cell further supports the hypotheses that Lyt-2 and L3T4 molecule in the mouse and Leu-2 and Leu-3 molecules in the human are involved in the interaction of the T cell with class-specific determinants on MHC molecules.
6228589 | Suppression of pokeweed mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin production in patients with rheumatoid arthritis after treatment with total lymphoid irradiation. Patients with intractable rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated with total lymphoid irradiation (TLI, 2000 rad). We previously reported long-lasting clinical improvement in this group associated with a persistent decrease in circulating Leu-3 (helper subset) T cells and marked impairment of in vitro lymphocyte function. In the present experiments, we studied the mechanisms underlying the decrease in pokeweed mitogen stimulated immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion observed after TLI. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBL) from TLI-treated patients produced 10-fold less Ig (both IgM and IgG) in response to pokeweed mitogen than before radiotherapy. This decrease in Ig production was associated with the presence of suppressor cells in co-culture studies. By using responder cells obtained from normal individuals (allogeneic system), PBL from eight of 12 patients after TLI suppressed Ig synthesis by more than 50%. In contrast, PBL from the same patients before TLI failed to suppress Ig synthesis. Suppression by post-TLI PBL was also demonstrated in an autologous system by using responder cells cryopreserved before TLI. Again, only cells obtained after TLI were suppressive in four of seven patients. PBL with suppressive activity contained suppressor T cells, and the latter cells bore the Leu-2 surface antigen. In 50% of the patients studied, suppressor cells were also found in the non-T fraction and were adherent to plastic. Interestingly, the Leu-2+ cells from TLI-treated patients were no more potent on a cell per cell basis than purified Leu-2+ cells obtained before TLI. Additional experiments suggested that the suppression mediated by T cells after TLI is related to the increased ratio of Leu-2 to Leu-3 cells observed after radiotherapy.
6236884 | Influenza virus-specific human cytotoxic T cell clones: heterogeneity in antigenic specificity and restriction by class II MHC products. Human cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for A/JAP/57 (H2N2) influenza virus were cloned from in vitro stimulations of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Analysis of the viral specificity in cytotoxic function revealed one clone that killed all type A influenza-infected targets, another clone that was specific for the hemagglutinin subtype of the immunizing influenza virus, and the third clone that demonstrated cytotoxicity restricted to the hemagglutinin of A/JAP/57 and A/JAP/62 (H2N2) and not other type A influenza strains with the H2N2 subtypes. The phenotype of these three clones was Leu 2-, Leu 3+, Leu 4+; MHC restriction of their cytotoxic function was mapped to HLA-DR by a panel of target cells as well as by inhibition of cytotoxicity with monoclonal antibodies. Proliferation of these clones, examined in a tritiated thymidine incorporation assay, was found to be driven by antigen in the absence of exogenous lymphokines. For all three clones antigen-dependent production and secretion of lymphokines with IL-2 activity was demonstrated. The antigen specificity of proliferation and factor production was shown to be identical to the pattern that each clone revealed in its cytotoxic function.
6288798 | Regeneration of T cell subpopulations after bone marrow transplantation: cytomegalovirus infection and lymphoid subset imbalance. Immune reconstitution was studied serially by using T lymphocyte cell surface differentiation antigens in 37 individuals receiving bone marrow transplants. Antigen expression was assessed by immunofluorescence analysis using monoclonal antibodies to T lymphocytes including Leu-3, which defines a T lymphocyte subpopulation in healthy individuals with T helper or inducer activity (L3+), and Leu-2, which defines a T lymphocyte subpopulation in healthy individuals with T helper or inducer activity (L3+), and Leu-2, which defines a T lymphocyte subpopulation with suppressor or cytotoxic activity (L2+). These studies demonstrated that the L2+ subpopulation regenerated more rapidly after transplant than did the L3+ subpopulation. Imbalances between these two T lymphocyte subpopulations, indicated by a decreased L3/L2 ratio, persisted for periods up to 12 mo post-transplant. Expression of a cell surface antigen associated with immature lymphocytes (OKT-10), and of HLA-DR (Ia-like) antigens was markedly increased during the post-transplant period. HLA-DR antigen expression did not appear related to immune activation in that increased reactivity was not detected with a monoclonal antibody (anti-TAC) specific for activated T cells. These observations in bone marrow transplant recipients and other disorders characterized by lymphoid restoration or immaturity indicate that inversion of the normal L3/L2 ratio and increased expression of OKT-10 and HLA-DR antigens may be features of a regenerating immune system. Furthermore, serial observation of individual patients indicated that infection with cytomegalovirus was associated with a progressive decrease in the L3/L2 ratio.
6413636 | The major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen receptor on T cells. II. Role of the L3T4 product. We have examined the role of the murine homologue of Leu-3 T4, L3T4, in recognition of antigen in association with products of the major histocompatibility complex (Ag/MHC) by murine T cell hybridomas. A series of ovalbumin (OVA)/I-Ad-specific T cell hybridomas were ranked in their sensitivity to Ag/I by measuring their ability to respond to low doses of OVA, or their sensitivity to inhibition by anti-I-Ad antibodies. T cell hybridomas with low apparent avidity for OVA/I-Ad, i.e. that did not respond well to low concentrations of OVA and were easily inhibited by anti-I-Ad, were also easily inhibited by anti-L3T4 antibodies. The reverse was true for T cell hybridomas with apparent high avidity for Ag/MHC. We found that the presence of low doses of anti-L3T4 antibodies caused T cell hybridomas to respond less well to low doses of Ag, and to be more easily inhibited by anti-I-Ad antibodies. These results suggested that the role of the L3T4 molecule is to increase the overall avidity of the reaction between T cells and Ag-presenting cells. In support of this idea was the discovery of several L3T4- subclones of one of our L3T4+ T cell hybridomas, D0.11.10. The L3T4- subclones had the same amount of receptor for OVA/I-Ad as their L3T4+ parent, as detected by an anti-receptor monoclonal antibody. The L3T4- subclones, however, responded less well to low doses of OVA, and were more easily inhibited by anti-I-Ad antibodies than their L3T4/ parent. These results showed that the L3T4 molecule was not required for surface expression of, or functional activity of, the T cell receptor for Ag/MHC. The L3T4 molecule did, however, increase the sensitivity with which the T cell reacted with Ag/MHC on Ag-presenting cells.
6415170 | Characterization of the murine T cell surface molecule, designated L3T4, identified by monoclonal antibody GK1.5: similarity of L3T4 to the human Leu-3/T4 molecule. Monoclonal antibody GK1.5 recognizes a previously undescribed murine T cell surface molecule, designated L3T4, which migrates on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as a single band with an apparent m.w. of 52,000. L3T4 is expressed by approximately 80% of thymocytes and by approximately 20% of spleen cells. There appears to be poor correlation between expression of L3T4 by functional T cell clones and expression of Lyt-2, expression of the cytolytic phenotype, and class I MHC antigen reactivity. On the other hand, both a class II MHC antigen-reactive HTL clone and an Lyt-1- Mls-reactive HTL clone express L3T4. Analysis of the effect of mAb GK1.5 on PFC responses in adoptive transfer suggests that L3T4 is expressed by the helper/inducer subset of murine T cells. Expression of L3T4 by murine T cells, however, may correlate primarily with class II MHC antigen reactivity rather than with functional phenotype; mAb GK1.5 profoundly blocks antigen-specific cytolysis by the cloned class II MHC antigen-reactive CTL line A15-1.17. Antigen-specific cytolysis by A15-1.17 is blocked by mAb GK1.5 at a step before the lethal hit. Collectively, the flow cytometric, functional, and biochemical data indicate that L3T4 is similar to the human Leu-3/T4 molecule.
7839069 | Defective mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity in untreated patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Peripheral blood mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity (MICC) was studied in 13 untreated patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA; group A) and in 5 RA patients with inactive disease (group B), using phytohemagglutinin (PHA) as stimulating agent and K562 cells as target cells in the chromium-51 release assay. MICC was found to be significantly reduced in the patients of group A compared with normal subjects (P < 0.01) and the patients of group B (P < 0.05). No differences were noted in MICC between group B patients and normal subjects. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between values of patients' MICC and serum C-reactive protein levels (r = -0.685, P < 0.01). Furthermore, patients' MICC correlated well with patients' peripheral blood natural killer cell activity (P < 0.02), as well as with the absolute number of circulating CD8+ cells. No correlation was found between MICC and duration of disease, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum alpha 2-globulins, or the titre of serum rheumatoid factor in the patients studied. We concluded that defective MICC in untreated patients with active RA is probably due to the diminution of the number of CD8+ cells, although a qualitative defect of these cells cannot be excluded.
8119634 | Patients with chronic LGL-proliferative disease express high mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity which may be partially mediated by soluble cytolytic molecules. Natural killer cell activity (NKa) and mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity (MICC) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were studied in five patients with chronic LGL-proliferative disease (LGL-PD) of the CD3+, CD8+, CD57+ phenotype. Both assays were performed under the same experimental conditions except that cultures for MICC contained phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at varying concentrations. Cytotoxicity was assessed against K562 cell targets using the 18 hours 51-chromium release assay. We found that LGL-PD lymphocytes of the aforementioned phenotype express low NKa but high MICC. Furthermore, supernatants derived from patients' PMBC cultures stimulated with PHA, displayed cytolytic properties comparable to those of normal lymphocytes. The findings indicate that MICC may be mediated, at least partially, by humoral cytolytic molecules. We concluded that LGL-PD lymphocytes are unable to express natural cytotoxicity but they have not lost the cytolytic machinery necessary for the destruction of sensitive target cells.
14581476 | Selective disruption of lysosomes in HeLa cells triggers apoptosis mediated by cleavage of Bid by multiple papain-like lysosomal cathepsins. Increasing evidence suggests that lysosomal proteases are actively involved in apoptosis. Using HeLa cells as the model system, we show that selective lysosome disruption with L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester results in apoptosis, characterized by translocation of lysosomal proteases into the cytosol and by the cleavage of a proapoptotic Bcl-2-family member Bid. Apoptosis and Bid cleavage, but not translocation of lysosomal proteases to the cytosol, could be prevented by 15 microM L-trans-epoxysuccinyl(OEt)-Leu-3-methylbutylamide, an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases. Incubation of cells with 15 microM N-benzoyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone prevented apoptosis but not Bid cleavage, suggesting that cathepsin-mediated apoptosis in this system is caspase-dependent. In vitro experiments performed at neutral pH showed that papain-like cathepsins B, H, L, S, and K cleave Bid predominantly at Arg(65) or Arg(71). No Bid cleavage was observed with cathepsins C and X or the aspartic protease cathepsin D. Incubation of full-length Bid treated with cathepsins B, H, L, and S resulted in rapid cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria. Thus, Bid may be an important mediator of apoptosis induced by lysosomal disruption.
22325941 | New cyclic peptides with osteoblastic proliferative activity from Dianthus superbus. Two new cyclic peptides, dianthins G-H (1 and 2), together with the known dianthin E (3), were isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Dianthus superbus. The sequences of cyclic peptides 1 and 2 were elucidated as cyclo (-Gly(1)-Pro(2)-Leu(3)-Thr(4)-Leu(5)-Phe(6)-) and cyclo (-Gly(1)-Pro(2)-Val(3)-Thr(4)-Ile(5)-Phe(6)-), on the basis of ESI tandem mass fragmentation analysis, extensive 2D NMR methods and X-ray diffraction. The isolated three compounds all increase proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro using MTT method.
23892571 | Comparative pharmacology of bombesin receptor subtype-3, nonpeptide agonist MK-5046, a universal peptide agonist, and peptide antagonist Bantag-1 for human bombesin receptors. Bombesin-receptor-subtype-3 (BRS-3) is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor of the bombesin (Bn) family whose natural ligand is unknown and which does not bind any natural Bn-peptide with high affinity. It is present in the central nervous system, peripheral tissues, and tumors; however, its role in normal physiology/pathophysiology is largely unknown because of the lack of selective ligands. Recently, MK-5046 [(2S)-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-[4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl]-3-(4-{[1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl]methyl}-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-2-ol] and Bantag-1 [Boc-Phe-His-4-amino-5-cyclohexyl-2,4,5-trideoxypentonyl-Leu-(3-dimethylamino) benzylamide N-methylammonium trifluoroacetate], a nonpeptide agonist and a peptide antagonist, respectively, for BRS-3 have been described, but there have been limited studies on their pharmacology. We studied MK-5046 and Bantag-1 interactions with human Bn-receptors-human bombesin receptor subtype-3 (hBRS-3), gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R), and neuromedin B receptor (NMB-R)-and compared them with the nonselective, peptide-agonist [d-Tyr6,betaAla11,Phe13,Nle14]Bn-(6-14) (peptide #1). Receptor activation was detected by activation of phospholipase C (PLC), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), paxillin, and Akt. In hBRS-3 cells, the relative affinities were Bantag-1 (1.3 nM) > peptide #1 (2 nM) > MK-5046 (37-160 nM) > GRP, NMB (>10 muM), and the binding-dose-inhibition curves were broad (>4 logs), with Hill coefficients differing significantly from unity. Curve-fitting demonstrated high-affinity (MK-5046, Ki = 0.08 nM) and low-affinity (MK-5046, Ki = 11-29 nM) binding sites. For PLC activation in hBRS-3 cells, the relative potencies were MK-5046 (0.02 nM) > peptide #1 (6 nM) > GRP, NMB, Bantag-1 (>10 muM), and MK-5046 had a biphasic dose response, whereas peptide #1 was monophasic. Bantag-1 was a specific hBRS-3-antagonist. In hBRS-3 cells, MK-5046 was a full agonist for activation of MAPK, FAK, Akt, and paxillin; however, it was a partial agonist for phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation. The kinetics of activation/duration of action for PLC/MAPK activation of MK-5046 and peptide #1 differed, with peptide #1 causing more rapid stimulation; however, MK-5046 had more prolonged activity. Our study finds that MK-5046 and Bantag-1 have high affinity/selectivity for hBRS-3. The nonpeptide MK-5046 and peptide #1 agonists differ markedly in their receptor coupling, ability to activate different signaling cascades, and kinetics/duration of action. These results show that their hBRS-3 receptor activation is not always concordant and could lead to markedly different cellular responses. 
23976975 | T4 phage and its head surface proteins do not stimulate inflammatory mediator production. Viruses are potent activators of the signal pathways leading to increased cytokine or ROS production. The effects exerted on the immune system are usually mediated by viral proteins. Complementary to the progress in phage therapy practice, advancement of knowledge about the influence of bacteriophages on mammalian immunity is necessary. Particularly, the potential ability of phage proteins to act like other viral stimulators of the immune system may have strong practical implications for the safety and efficacy of bacteriophage therapy. Here we present studies on the effect of T4 phage and its head proteins on production of inflammatory mediators and inflammation-related factors: IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40/p70, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, MIG, RANTES, GCSF, GM-CSF and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Plasma cytokine profiles in an in vivo mouse model and in human blood cells treated with gp23*, gp24*, Hoc and Soc were evaluated by cytokine antibody arrays. Cytokine production and expression of CD40, CD80, CD86 and MHC class II molecules were also investigated in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells treated with whole T4 phage particle or the same capsid proteins. The influence of T4 and gp23*, gp24*, Hoc and Soc on reactive oxygen species generation was examined in blood cells using luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay. In all performed assays, the T4 bacteriophage and its capsid proteins gp23*, gp24*, Hoc and Soc did not affect production of inflammatory-related cytokines or ROS. These observations are of importance for any medical or veterinary application of bacteriophages. 
24024019 | Comparative study of levamisole-selenium supplementation effect on CD4 increase in HlV / AIDS patients. BACKGROUND: Given to the abundant incidence of malnutrition in HIV(+) patients and its effect on progress of AIDS disease, several studies have recommended supplementation therapy (such as Selenium, Levamisole, Zinc). METHODS: This clinical trial was prefunded on patient's with HIV + in Behavior Diseases Consulting Center, Kermanshah, Iran 2006-2007. One hundred-seventy eight out of all patients with CD4 1ess than 350 cell/mm(3) who did not receive antiretroviral drugs were in this study. They were divided into four groups: the first group received 200 micg selenium per day, the second group received levamisole 50 mg every other day, and third group received both two drugs. The fourth group was the control group. All four groups were studied for six months. Patients' baseline CD4 and other data were recorded in a form. CD4 was rechecked after six months and collected values were compared with basic values. CD4 changes were compared among all groups, either. RESULTS: One hundred-seventy eight patients initiated treatment and 108 cooperated in the 6-month follow up assessment. Niuety-two (85%) were males and 15% were female. CD4 decreased in control group and Levamisole group during the study which was significant, but 13 units increase was seen in Selenium-Levamisole group. CD4 count decreased 36 units in Selenium group. Comparing CD4 count change among 4 study groups showed that only CD4 change between Selenium-Levamisole group and control group was significant. CONCLUSION: Regarding to collected results, Selenium-Levamisole supplementation can be used as a supplementation therapy besides antiretroviral therapies.
24246300 | Role of thyroid hormones and mir-208 in myocardial remodeling in 5/6 nephrectomized rats. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thyroid hormones exert important effects on heart remodeling through mir-208. The process may have a role in myocardial changes in chronic kidney disease where thyroid abnormalities are common. In this study the effect of T4 supplementation on left ventricle (LV) remodeling in 5/6 nephrectomized rats (5/6Nx) was analyzed. METHODS: 5/6Nx rats and 5/6Nx under T4 supplementation (5/6Nx + T4) were compared with control (C) and thyroidectomized (Tx) rats. After 8 weeks of follow-up, LV was analyzed for alpha-MHC, beta-MHC, TGF-beta, and mir-208 expression, hydroxyproline content, and myocardial fibrosis. Serum collagenase activity was also analyzed. RESULTS: Heart weight increased in 5/6Nx rats compared to C, which was prevented with T4 supplementation (C, 1.5 +- 0.04; 5/6Nx, 1.8 +- 0.09; 5/6Nx + T4, 1.6 +- 0.07 g, p <0.05). The same pattern was seen for LV wall thickness, hydroxyproline content, LV fibrosis, and mRNA TGF-beta expression (C, 0.47 +- 0.17; 5/6Nx, 10.55 +- 3.4; 5/6Nx + T4, 3.01 +- 0.52, p <0.01). Tx rats had reduction in heart weight, increased LV wall thickness, and fibrosis. Collagenase activity did not change in any group. mRNA expression of alpha-, beta-MHC, and TGF-beta increased in 5/6Nx in comparison to C and 5/6Nx + T4. Expression of mir-208 decreased in 5/6Nx groups, and levels were restored with T4 supplementation (4.21 +- 0.28, 3.39 +- 0.29, and 4.26 +- 0.37 RU, respectively, p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased plasma level of thyroid hormones or sensitivity at tissue level observed in chronic kidney disease induced by 5/6Nx has an important effect in heart remodeling processes, some of it related or mediated by mir-208 and TGF-beta expression in the heart.
24465787 | Regenerative therapies for equine degenerative joint disease: a preliminary study. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is a major cause of reduced athletic function and retirement in equine performers. For this reason, regenerative therapies for DJD have gained increasing interest. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from a 6-year-old donor horse. MSCs were either used in their native state or after chondrogenic induction. In an initial study, 20 horses with naturally occurring DJD in the fetlock joint were divided in 4 groups and injected with the following: 1) PRP; 2) MSCs; 3) MSCs and PRP; or 4) chondrogenic induced MSCs and PRP. The horses were then evaluated by means of a clinical scoring system after 6 weeks (T1), 12 weeks (T2), 6 months (T3) and 12 months (T4) post injection. In a second study, 30 horses with the same medical background were randomly assigned to one of the two combination therapies and evaluated at T1. The protein expression profile of native MSCs was found to be negative for major histocompatibility (MHC) II and p63, low in MHC I and positive for Ki67, collagen type II (Col II) and Vimentin. Chondrogenic induction resulted in increased mRNA expression of aggrecan, Col II and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) as well as in increased protein expression of p63 and glycosaminoglycan, but in decreased protein expression of Ki67. The combined use of PRP and MSCs significantly improved the functionality and sustainability of damaged joints from 6 weeks until 12 months after treatment, compared to PRP treatment alone. The highest short-term clinical evolution scores were obtained with chondrogenic induced MSCs and PRP. This study reports successful in vitro chondrogenic induction of equine MSCs. In vivo application of (induced) MSCs together with PRP in horses suffering from DJD in the fetlock joint resulted in a significant clinical improvement until 12 months after treatment. 
24476479 | Exercise training induced myosin heavy chain isoform alteration in the infarcted heart. The myosin heavy chain isoform MHC-alpha has 3-fold higher ATPase activity than MHC-beta. After myocardial infarction (MI), MHC-alpha expression is profoundly downregulated and MHC-beta expression is reciprocally upregulated. This shift, which is attributed to low thyroid hormone (TH), contributes to myocardial systolic dysfunction. We investigated the effect of post-MI exercise training on MHC isoforms, TH, and cardiac function. MI was surgically induced in 7-week-old rats by ligation of the coronary artery. The survivors were assigned to 3 groups (n = 10/group): Sham (no MI, no exercise), MISed (MI, no exercise), and MIEx (MI, exercise). Treadmill exercise training began 1 week post-MI and lasted for 8 weeks. Echocardiogram measurements were taken on the day prior to initiation of exercise training and at the end of exercise training. Tissue and blood samples were collected at the end of the experiment. MHC isoform gene and protein expression and TH were measured. Our results illustrated that MHC-alpha gene expression was higher and MHC-beta gene expression was lower in the MIEx group than in the MISed group. Resting serum TH concentrations (T3 and T4) were similar between the 2 MI groups. The MIEx group had higher fractional shortening than the MISed group. In conclusion, post-MI exercise training beneficially altered MHC isoforms and improved cardiac function without changing TH. 
25124902 | [The effect of calpeptin on injury and atrophy of diaphragm under mechanical ventilation in rats]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of calpeptin on diaphragmatic injury and atrophy under controlled mechanical ventilation in rats. METHODS: A total of 24 SPF Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into anesthetized control group (CON group), 24-hour controlled mechanical ventilation group (CMV group), and 24-hour CMV + treatment with calpeptin group (CMVC group), with 8 rats in each group. Animals in the CON group received an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium without CMV and continuous infusion of pentobarbital sodium. A small-animal ventilator was used for 24 hours in rats of CMV group. Rats of CMVC were treated with a specific calpain inhibitor calpeptin (4 mg/kg). The drug was injected subcutaneously 2 hours before and 8, 15 and 23 hours after mechanical ventilation. Changes in diaphragm ultrastructure, light microscopic picture, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression were observed. RESULTS: (1) Alignment of myofilaments and normal Z-band, and the shape of mitochondria were maintained in CON group as revealed by electron microscope. The signs of misalignment of myofibrils, disruption of Z-band and vacuolar mitochondria were found in CMV group, and they were obviously improved in CMVC group. The density of muscle injury (x 10-2/mum2) in CMV group was significantly higher than that in control group (36.8 +- 13.7 vs. 6.4 +- 6.3, t=6.373, P=0.001), and that in CMVC group was significantly lowered (17.6 +- 9.1 vs. 36.8 +- 13.7, t=3.694, P=0.002).(2) In CON group, the diaphragm fibers appeared regular in cross section without pathologic change under light microscopy. Fuzzy muscle striations, irregular muscle fibers, centralized nuclei and swelling of capillary endothelial cells were observed in CMV group, while pathological changes in the CMVC group were milder significantly. (3) In CMV group, the density of MHCslow and MHCfast was lower compared with that of CON group, and the gray value was lowered by 61.1% (t=8.138, P=0.001) and 77.1% (t=8.844, P=0.001), respectively, especially in MHCfast. However, the gray values of MHCslow and MHCfast were increased by 1.51 folds (t=4.601, P=0.010), and 1.33 folds (t=2.859, P=0.011), respectively, after treatment with calpeptin, and the elevation was more significantly in MHCslow. CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic injury and atrophy were found after CMV for 24 hours. Calpeptin could reverse the detrimental effects of CMV, and it suggested that calpain plays an important role in modulating the ventilator-induced dysfunction of the diaphragm.
25736108 | [Construction of a vector encoding T-cell epitopes of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus major allergen group 1 as a vaccine delivered by MHC class II pathway]. OBJECTIVE: To construct a vector encoding T-cell epitopes of major allergen group 1 of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus as a vaccine delivered by MHC class II pathway. METHODS: The nucleotide sequences of the 3 target genes were synthesized, including TAT, IhC and the recombinant fragment of Der p 1 encoding 3 T-cell epitopes. After amplification of the 3 target fragments by PCR and digestion with corresponding restriction endonucleases, the recombinant gene TAT-IhC-Der p 1-3T was ligated using T4 DNA ligase and inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pET28a(+) to construct the recombinant plasmid pET-28a(+)-TAT-IhC-Der p 1-3T, which was confirmed by digestion with restriction endonucleases and sequencing. The recombinant vector was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and induced with IPTG, and the induced protein TAT-IhC-Der p 1-3T was detected by SDS-PAGE. After purification, the recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blotting and its allergenicity tested using IgE-binding assay. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid pET-28a-TAT-IhC-Der p 1-3T was successfully constructed as confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and sequencing and the expression of the recombinant protein TAT-IhC-Der p 1-3T was induced in E. coli. Western blotting verified successfull purification of the target protein, which showed a stronger IgE-binding ability than Der p 1. CONCLUSION: We successfully constructed a recombinant expression vector pET-28a-TAT-IhC-Der p 1-3T expressing a T-cell epitope vaccine delivered by MHC II pathway with strong IgE-binding ability, which provides a basis for further study on specific immunotherapy via MHC class II pathway.
26343707 | Structural Conservation and Functional Diversity of the Poxvirus Immune Evasion (PIE) Domain Superfamily. Poxviruses encode a broad array of proteins that serve to undermine host immune defenses. Structural analysis of four of these seemingly unrelated proteins revealed the recurrent use of a conserved beta-sandwich fold that has not been observed in any eukaryotic or prokaryotic protein. Herein we propose to call this unique structural scaffolding the PIE (Poxvirus Immune Evasion) domain. PIE domain containing proteins are abundant in chordopoxvirinae, with our analysis identifying 20 likely PIE subfamilies among 33 representative genomes spanning 7 genera. For example, cowpox strain Brighton Red appears to encode 10 different PIEs: vCCI, A41, C8, M2, T4 (CPVX203), and the SECRET proteins CrmB, CrmD, SCP-1, SCP-2, and SCP-3. Characterized PIE proteins all appear to be nonessential for virus replication, and all contain signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. The PIE subfamilies differ primarily in the number, size, and location of structural embellishments to the beta-sandwich core that confer unique functional specificities. Reported ligands include chemokines, GM-CSF, IL-2, MHC class I, and glycosaminoglycans. We expect that the list of ligands and receptors engaged by the PIE domain will grow as we come to better understand how this versatile structural architecture can be tailored to manipulate host responses to infection.

27582733 | The Effects of T4 and A3/R Bacteriophages on Differentiation of Human Myeloid Dendritic Cells. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses of bacteria. Here we evaluated the effects of T4 and A3/R bacteriophages, as well as phage-generated bacterial lysates, on differentiation of human myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) from monocytes. Neither of the phages significantly reduced the expression of markers associated with differentiation of DCs and their role in the activation of T cells (CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD1c, CD11c, MHC II, PD-L1, PD-L2, TLR2, TLR4, and CCR7) and phagocytosis receptors (CD64 and DEC-205). By contrast, bacterial lysate of T4 phage significantly decreased the percentages of DEC-205- and CD1c-positive cells. The percentage of DEC-205-positive cells was also significantly reduced in DCs differentiated in the presence of lysate of A3/R phage. Thus while bacteriophages do not substantially affect differentiation of DCs, some products of phage-induced lysis of bacterial cells may influence the differentiation and potentially also some functions of DCs. Our results have important implications for phage therapy of bacterial infections because during infections monocytes recruited to the site of inflammation are an important source of inflammatory DCs. 
27663841 | Exogenous apelin changes alpha and beta myosin heavy chain mRNA expression and improves cardiac function in PTU-induced hypothyroid rats. The most important conditions associated with hypothyroidism is the cardiac dysfunction. Apelin is an endogenous ligand, involved in energy storage and metabolism which improves cardiac contractility. This study was done to evaluate the effects of apelin, l-Thyroxin (T4) or a combination of both, on cardiac function and mRNA expression of two contractile proteins, alpha and beta myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC and beta-MHC), in 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroid rats. Forty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into five groups: Ctrl (Control), and 4 hypothyroid groups (H, HA, HT, and HAT). The Hypothyroid (H) group received 0.05% PTU in the drinking water for six weeks; the next 3 groups, along with PTU, received apelin (HA, 200mug/kg/day, ip), T4 (HT, 20mug/kg/day, gavage), or a combination of both drugs (HAT) for the last 2weeks (weeks 5 and 6). TSH and T4 were measured using ELISA kit. Isolated hearts of animals were perfused in Langendorff apparatus and left ventricular developed pressure, cardiac contractility, heart rate, rate pressure product and perfusion pressure were assessed using PowerLab ADInstruments. In addition alpha-MHC and beta-MHC mRNA expression were evaluated by RT-PCR method in heart tissue. Apelin alone or accompanied by T4 significantly increased cardiac contractility and performance as compared to hypothyroid group. Apelin also significantly increased the alpha-MHC mRNA expression and in the presence of T4 significantly decreased beta-MHC mRNA expression. It seems that apelin alone may improve cardiac function in hypothyroid rats via genomic pathways.
28755749 | Increased expression of M1 and M2 phenotypic markers in isolated microglia after four-day binge alcohol exposure in male rats. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation are common features of neurodegenerative conditions, including alcohol use disorders (AUDs). When activated, microglia span a continuum of diverse phenotypes ranging from classically activated, pro-inflammatory (M1) microglia/macrophages to alternatively activated, growth-promoting (M2) microglia/macrophages. Identifying microglia phenotypes is critical for understanding the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AUDs. Therefore, male rats were gavaged with 25% (w/v) ethanol or isocaloric control diet every 8 h for 4 days and sacrificed at 0, 2, 4, and 7 days after alcohol exposure (e.g., T0, T2, etc.). Microglia were isolated from hippocampus and entorhinal cortices by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Cells were labeled with microglia surface antigens and analyzed by flow cytometry. Consistent with prior studies, isolated cells yielded a highly enriched population of brain macrophages/microglia (>95% pure), evidenced by staining for the macrophage/microglia antigen CD11b. Polarization states of CD11b+CD45low microglia were evaluated by expression of M1 surface markers, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, CD32, CD86, and M2 surface marker, CD206 (mannose receptor). Ethanol-treated animals begin to show increased expression of M1 and M2 markers at T0 (p = n.s.), with significant changes at the T2 time point. At T2, expression of M1 markers, MHC-II, CD86, and CD32 were increased (p < 0.05) in hippocampus and entorhinal cortices, while M2 marker, CD206, was increased significantly only in entorhinal cortices (p < 0.05). All effects resolved to control levels by T4. In summary, four-day binge alcohol exposure produces a transient increase in both M1 (MHC-II, CD32, and CD86) and M2 (CD206) populations of microglia isolated from the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these findings that both pro-inflammatory and potentially beneficial, recovery-promoting microglia phenotypes can be observed after a damaging exposure of alcohol are critically important to our understanding of the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AUDs.
28915538 | Long-term T3 and T4 treatment as an alternative to aerobic exercise training in improving cardiac function post-myocardial infarction. Here we aimed to compare the beneficial effects of T3 and T4 hormone treatment to those provided by aerobic exercise training in Wistar rats post-myocardial infarction (MI). Rats in one group were SHAM-operated and in the other group were subjected to MI surgery. One week after surgery, the MI group animals either received T3 and T4 hormones by gavage or underwent a low intensity aerobic exercise training protocol on a treadmill, and both treatments lasted until 10 weeks after MI. Untreated SHAM-operated and MI groups were also followed for the same duration. The cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and catheterization, followed by blood collection (to measure T3, T4, and TSH hormones), and euthanasia. The lung, liver, heart, and tibia were collected (to assess hypertrophy and congestion indices). The left ventricle homogenate (without a scar) was used for the analyses of calcium handling proteins. Results showed that enhanced cardiac function was promoted by both interventions, with infarct size reduction, increased ejection fraction, and diastolic posterior wall thickness, but no alterations in heart rate, cardiac output, or T3, T4, and TSH levels. There was a positive force-frequency relationship accompanied by increased alpha-MHC, as well as decreased HSP70 protein expression. In conclusion, the effects of T3 and T4 hormone treatments were similar, and in some parameters superior, to those provided by the aerobic exercise training. Thus, lower doses of thyroid hormones could be more suitable as a coadjuvant treatment after MI, as a plausible alternative for patients who are intolerant to aerobic exercise training.
29700476 | Quality of life, burden and satisfaction with care in caregivers of patients with a spinal cord injury during and after rehabilitation. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To examine the course that burden, quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with care taken in Dutch caregivers of patients with a SCI. SETTING: Adelante Rehabilitation Centre and Dutch community, the Netherlands METHODS: Caregiver Strain index (CSI), Short Form36 (SF-36) and Caregivers' Satisfaction with (Stroke) Care Questionnaire (C-SASC) were administered to caregivers (n = 37) of patients with a recently acquired SCI at the start of rehabilitation (T1), discharge from rehabilitation (T2) and at 8 weeks (T3), 6 months (T4) and 18 months after discharge (T5). RESULTS: During rehabilitation, 20 caregivers (54%) experienced high levels of burden (cutoff >6). CSI scores significantly decreased during follow-up (median CSI score T1:7 IQR[5,10], T5:4 IQR[1,7], p = 0.010), at T5 5 caregivers (24%) scored >6 on burden. Initial low scores on QoL improved significantly in the SF-36 domains 'social-functioning', 'emotional-role-functioning', 'mental health' and 'vitality'. Overall satisfaction with care of caregivers was good (C-SASC: median 3, IQR[3,4]) and stable over time. Moderate strongly negative correlations were found between total CSI-score and 'social-functioning' (T2-T3-T4), 'emotional-role-functioning' (all time points), 'mental health' (all time points) and 'vitality' (all time points) with p values < 0.041. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the high burden and a low QoL on the 'the Mental Health Component' domains (or MHC) of caregivers during inpatient rehabilitation. During the early home phase, we found a significant improvement in burden and MHC. Clinicians working with both SCI-patients and caregivers should be aware of the possible high burden and low QoL of caregivers during rehabilitation.
30200092 | Preoperative oral thyroid hormones to prevent euthyroid sick syndrome and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in children: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Both euthyroid sick syndrome and myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury are common and have been significantly associated with morbidity and mortality after pediatric cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. This single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled clinical pilot trial was designed to assess if preoperative oral thyroid hormone therapy could prevent the occurrence of euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in children. METHODS: Forty children aged 3 to 12 year, scheduled for elective congenital heart disease repair surgery with CPB, were randomized into 2 groups of equal size to receive the following treatments in a double-blind manner: placebo (control group) and thyroid tablet 0.4 mg/kg (trial group) taken orally once a day for 4 days before surgery. The perioperative serum thyroid hormone levels and hemodynamic variables were determined. The extubation time, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and use of inotropic drugs in the ICU were recorded. The myocardial expressions of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), myosin heavy chain (MHC) mRNA, and thyroid hormone receptor (TR) mRNA were detected. The serum creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) activity and troponin I (TnI) positive ratio at 24 hour after surgery were assessed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in hemodynamic variables at all observed points, extubation time, and duration of ICU stay between groups. As compared with baselines on administration, serum triiodothyronine (T3) and free T3 (FT3) levels on the first, second, and fourth postoperative day, and serum thyrotropic-stimulating hormone (TSH), tetraiodothyronine (T4), and free T4 (FT4) levels on the first postoperative day were significantly decreased in the 2 groups. Serum T3, FT3, and T4 levels on the first and second postoperative day, and serum FT4 level on the first postoperative day were significantly higher in the trial group than in control group. As compared with the control group, the number of patients requiring inotropic drugs in the ICU, serum CK-MB activity, serum positive TnI ratio, and myocardial expression of MHCbeta mRNA were significantly decreased, and myocardial expressions of both HSP70 and MHCalpha mRNA were significantly increased in the trial group. CONCLUSIONS: In children undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB, preoperative oral small-dose thyroid hormone therapy reduces severity of postoperative ESS and provides a protection against myocardial IRI by increasing HSP70 and MHCalpha expression.
30805880 | The effects of clinical illness severity and physical activity on health-related quality of life in schizophrenia. BACKGROUND: Quality of life is an important clinical outcome in individuals with schizophrenia. Illness severity and physical activity (PA) were independently reported to influence health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with schizophrenia. This study attempts to examine the intensity and types of PA and their impact on HRQoL, as well as the relative contributions of illness severity, PA, and sedentary behavior (SB) to HRQoL in people with schizophrenia. METHODS: Demographic information was collected from 297 community-dwelling individuals with schizophrenia. Severity of illness was assessed on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S); PA and SB were assessed on the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ); HRQoL was assessed on the RAND-36. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the impact of different types and intensities of PA on HRQoL, and the relative impact of CGI-S, GPAQ-PA, and GPAQ-SB on HRQoL. RESULTS: Most participants had low PA level, and travel is the main type of PA adopted. Leisure time, travel-related, work-related, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity PA were all not associated with HRQoL. Lower severity of illness was significantly associated with better physical (PHC), mental (MHC) and global (GHC) health composites of the RAND-36 (GHC: t = - 5.628, p < 0.001, PHC: t = - 4.026, p < 0.001, MHC: t = - 5.534, p < 0.001). Both PA and SB were not significantly associated with PHC, MHC, and GHC. CONCLUSION: Severity of illness has a significant impact on HRQoL in people with schizophrenia. However, we found no evidence to support the association between physical activity and sedentary behavior with HRQoL.
31112742 | Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) activation in the cardiac hypertrophy of hyperthyroidism. Ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the main proteolytic pathway in eukaryotic cells. Changes in proteasome expression and activity have been associated to cardiovascular diseases as cardiac hypertrophy. Considering that cardiac hypertrophy is commonly associated to hyperthyroidism condition, the present study aimed to investigate the contribution of UPS in cardiac hypertrophy induced by thyroid hormones. Hyperthyroidism was induced in male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injections of triiodothyronine (T3; 7  mug/100 g of body weight) for 7 days and confirmed by raised levels of total T3 and decreased levels of total T4. In addition, systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly increased in hyperthyroid group. Cardiac hypertrophy was confirmed in hyperthyroid group by increased heart weight/tibia length ratio and by increased alpha-MHC/beta-MHC relative expression. Both catalytic (20SPT) and regulatory subunits (19SPT) of the constitutive proteasome were upregulated in hyperthyroid hearts. In addition, the transcripts that encode immunoproteasome subunits were also elevated. Furthermore, ATP-dependent chymotrypsin-like activity (26SPT) was significantly increased in hyperthyroid group. Despite the upregulation and activation of UPS in hyperthyroid hearts, the content of polyubiquitinated proteins was unaltered in relation to control. Together, these results evidence the activation of cardiac proteasome by thyroid hormones, which possibly contribute to the maintenance of protein quality control and regulation of cardiac hypertrophy in response to thyroid hormones.
31522342 | miR-762 modulates thyroxine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting Beclin-1. PURPOSE: Whether autophagy plays a key role in thyroxine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and whether the role of autophagy in thyroxine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is related to targeting of Beclin-1 by miR-762 remains unclear. This research focused on testing these two hypotheses. Importantly, the results of this study will help us better understand the molecular mechanisms of thyroxine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. METHODS: In vivo and in vitro, RT-PCR, western blot, and dual luciferase reporter assay were performed to understand the molecular mechanism of thyroxine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. HE staining, Masson staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were used to observe intuitively changes of hearts and cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: Our results showed that in vivo, serum TT3, TT4, and heart rate were significantly upregulated in the T4 group compared with the control group. Moreover, the surface area of cardiomyocytes was significantly increased in the T4 group, and the structural disorder was accompanied by obvious hyperplasia of collagen fibers. The expression of ANP, and beta-MHC was significantly upregulated in the T4 group. In addition, LC3 II/LC3 I, Beclin-1 and the count of autophagic vacuoles were significantly upregulated, but miR-762 was significantly downregulated in the T4 group compared to the control group. Subsequently, a dual luciferase reporter assay suggested that Beclin-1 was the target gene of miR-762. In vitro, the results for the T3 group were consistent with the results for the T4 group. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and autophagic activity were attenuated in the T3 + miR-762 mimic group compared with the T3 group. In contrast, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and autophagic activity were aggravated in the T3 + miR-762 inhibitor group compared with the T3 group. CONCLUSIONS: miR-762 modulates thyroxine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by inhibiting Beclin-1.
32512181 | Degradation of thymic humoral factor gamma2 in human, rat and mouse blood: An experimental and theoretical study. The degradation of the immunomodulatory octapeptide, thymic humoral factor gamma2 (THF-gamma2, thymoctonan) has been studied in whole blood samples from human, rat and mouse. The peptide, Leu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Phe-Leu, was shown to be rapidly degraded by peptidases. The half-life of the intact peptide was less than 6 min at 37  C in blood from the three species tested. The main fragments formed from THF-gamma2 were found to be Glu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Phe-Leu (2-8), Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys-Phe-Leu (3-8) and Glu-Asp-Gly-Pro-Lys (2-6) in human and in rat blood and 2-8 and 2-6 in mouse blood. Analysis of the time course of degradation revealed a sequential removal of single amino acids from the N-terminus (aminopeptidase activities) in a process that was apparently unable to cleave the Gly-Pro bond (positions 4-5 in the peptide) together with an independent cleavage of the Lys-Phe bond (positions 6-7 in the peptide) to release the dipeptide Phe-Leu. This behaviour and the effects of inhibitors showed the involvement of metallo-exopeptidases in the N-terminal digestion and a phosphoramidon-sensitive metallo-endopeptidase in the cleavage of the Lys-Phe bond. The degradation patterns in human blood were modelled in terms of the competing pathways involved approximating to first-order kinetics, and an analytical solution obtained via the method of Laplace Transforms. The half-life of THF degradation in whole rat blood sample was found to be significantly lower than in human or mouse.
32793221 | Targeting the Protective Arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System to Reduce Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Related Pathologies in MRL-lpr Mice. Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) suffer from a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that results from the body's immune system targeting healthy tissues which causes damage to various organ systems. Patients with lupus are still in need of effective therapies to treat this complex, multi-system disease. Because polymorphisms in ACE are associated with the activity of SLE and lupus nephritis and based on well-documented renal-protective effects of Renin Angiotensin System (RAS)-modifying therapies, ACE-I are now widely used in patients with SLE with significant efficacy. Our research explores alternate ways of modifying the RAS as a potential for systemic therapeutic benefit in the MRL-lpr mouse model of SLE. These therapeutics include; angiotensin (1-7) [A(1-7)], Nor-Leu-3 Angiotensin (1-7) (NorLeu), Losartan (ARB), and Lisinopril (ACE-I). Daily systemic treatment with all of these RAS-modifying therapies significantly reduced the onset and intensity in rash formation and swelling of the paw. Further, histology showed a corresponding decrease in hyperkeratosis and acanthosis in skin sections. Important immunological parameters such as decreased circulating anti-dsDNA antibodies, lymph node size, and T cell activation were observed. As expected, the development of glomerular pathologies was also attenuated by RAS-modifying therapy. Improved number and health of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as well as reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation may be contributing to the reduction in SLE pathologies. Several studies have already characterized the protective role of ACE-I and ARBs in mouse models of SLE, here we focus on the protective arm of RAS. A(1-7) in particular demonstrates several protective effects that go beyond those seen with ACE-Is and ARBs; an important finding considering that ACE-Is and ARBs are teratogenic and can cause hypotension in this population. These results offer a foundation for further pharmaceutical development of RAS-modifying therapies, that target the protective arm, as novel SLE therapeutics that do not rely on suppressing the immune system.
37116030 | A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Possible Role of Cholecalciferol Supplementation on Autoimmunity in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. A Prospective Study to Evaluate the Possible Role of Cholecalciferol Supplementation on Autoimmunity in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Biva Bhakat1 , Jyotirmoy Pal2 , Sukdeb Das3 , Sumit Kr Charaborty4 1,3Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College, Kolkata, 2 RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, 4 North Bengal Medical College, Siliguri Introduction: Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is an autoimmune disease that destroys thyroid cells by antibody and call-mediated immune processes. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the commonest cause of goitre in iodine-sufficient regions.[1] The aetiology of Hashimoto disease is very poorly understood. Most patients develop antibodies to a variety of thyroid antigens, the most common of which is&nbsp;anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO). Many also form antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and TSH receptor blocking antibodies (TBII). These antibodies attack the thyroid tissue, eventually leading to inadequate production of thyroid hormone. There is a small subset of the population, around 10-15% with the clinically evident disease, that are serum antibody-negative.[2][3] The mechanisms underlying the assumption that vitamin D is linked with autoimmunity are not clear but probably are associated with its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. The dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells originating from bone marrow and also a primary target for the immunomodulatory activity of vitamin D. 1,25[OH]2D has direct immunomodulatory effects at the level of the T cell vitamin D receptor. Together, these immunomodulatory effects can lead to the protection of target tissues, such as thyroid cells in autoimmune diseases. Considering that in HT, a disorder of T cell-mediated immunity, immunologic attack is triggered when thyrocytes express MHC class II surface HLA-DR antigens, a process induced by the production of Th1 type inflammatory cytokines (especially IFN-gamma). Moreover, at another stage, after being activated by T cells, B cells' ongoing proliferation might be inhibited and apoptosis might be induced by 1,25[OH]2D. Thus, 1,25[OH]2D might decrease antibodies that react with thyroid antigens. The exact levels of vitamin D that are sufficient to improve the immune regulatory function and lead to an effective immune response, should be investigated. Several clinical studies have reported a low vitamin D status in AITD or HT, indicating an association between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid autoimmunity. If supplementation of the Vitamin D decreased thyroid antibody titres in Vitamin D deficient subjects, in the future Vitamin D may become a part of AITDs' treatment, especially in those with Vitamin D deficiency. [4] So, our study tries to assess any potential therapeutic role of vitamin D in the management of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Most studies have shown an association between low vitamin D status and pathogenesis of AITD, especially HT. However, there are only few preliminary interventional studies for HT. whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for AITD or HT, should be evaluated. Treatment of HT mainly based on thyroid hormone supplementation, so if a beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation is identified/ confirmed, it will be helpful in the treatment of patients with HT and may be a part of treatment of HT patients. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the role of vitamin D on an excessive thyroid immune response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study area: N.R.S. Medical college and hospital, Kolkata (Department of General Medicine). STUDY PERIOD: 1 year (January,2019 to December,2019 Sample size: 100 patients both male and female. Sample Design: Patients attending outpatient dept in N.R.S medical college. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, hospital based, single centre study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Newly diagnosed patients (age >18 years and of both sexes) with HT and vitamin D deficiency. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients suffering from: Other autoimmune diseases. Chronic illnesses like diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, malignancy. Pregnancy Study tools: Estimation from serum: TSH. Free thyroxine (FT4) 25 hydroxy vitamin D Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody' Study techniques: This is a prospective study conducted in N.R.S Medical college, Kolkata, India. Total 100 adult patients of both sexes diagnosed with HT and vitamin D deficiency (vit D<30 ng/ml)12, having none of the exclusion criteria and getting treatment on out-patient department basis, who gave informed consent were included in our study. Blood samples drawn for anti TPO antibody and 25hydroxy vitamin D from all the participants. The correlations between serum Vit D and anti TPO antibody were measured and presented by correlation coef ficient (r2). Study participants are randomly assigned into two groups by random permuted block. Cholecalciferol supplement given in the dose of 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks in one group (n = 50). Another group (n = 50) were given placebo (empty soft gelatine capsule). At the onset of the study, patients were requested to keep their habitual diet and routine level of physical activity throughout the study period and not to take any medication that might affect their reproductive physiology. Compliance to the consumption of supplement and placebo was examined by empty blister packets. However, 2 patients from cholecalciferol group and 1 patient from control group lost to follow up. After 8 weeks blood anti TPO antibody level measured in both the groups (n = 48 &amp; 49 in 2 group). The change in the mean value of anti TPO antibody measured and statistical significance of the change checked. Results considered significant or non-significant when P> or < 0.05, respectively. TSH, T4 measurement Performed with chemiluminescence using ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay System. Work plan: Study was done over 12 months. Data collected and compilation done and then statistical analysis done by standard statistical method. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: For statistical analysis data were entered into a Microsoft excel spreadsheet and then analyzed by SPSS (version 27.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism version 5. p-value <= 0.05 was considered for statistically significant. The Negative Correlation was found between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/ml) vs Serum TSH (mU/L) which was statistically significant. Distribution of mean serum anti-TPO antibody level (IU/ml) [mean+-SD] in both groups before and after intervention <img src=\https://www.japi.org/article/images/2023-01-08_1673190869.png\ style=\width: 274px;\> Reduction of serum anti-TPO antibody level in cholecalciferol group is 30.5% and reduction of serum anti-TPO antibody level in placebo group is 16.5%. DISCUSSION: This study is carried out with the total no. of 100 outdoor based patients of diagnosed Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (elevated Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody) and vitamin D deficiency (vit D < 30 ng/mL)12 in Nil Ratan Sircar medical college and hospital within the mentioned study period. The study focussed on evaluating the role of vitamin D on an excessive thyroid immune response i.e. the effect of vitamin D supplementation on thyroid autoimmunity and that low vitamin D levels and the risk of HT are closely associated and the potential application of vitamin D in the treatment of AITD. The result demonstrates a negative Correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL) vs anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) which was statistically significant. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)= -0.775, p value = 0.0001. Goswami et al. conducted a community-based survey on 642 adults to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D concentrations and thyroid autoimmunity. Their results highlighted a significant inverse association between 25(OH)D3 and TPO Ab levels [40]. This inverse correlation was substantiated in the following studies.[5-8] As regards thyroid function in the context of HT, Mackawy and co-workers demonstrated a strong negative association between serum vitamin D concentrations and TSH levels, leading to speculate that vitamin D deficiency in HT patients could be associated with a progression towards hypothyroidism (TSH > 5.0 m UI/L) [45]. Our study also demonstrates negative Correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL) vs Serum TSH (mU/L) and the result was statistically significant. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) = -0.301, p value = 0.003. So, the results indicate that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Mean (mean+- s.d.) Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) before intervention was 545.06+- 230.82 and after cholecalciferol supplementation the mean value decreased to 378.6+- 160.49. So, there is a 30.5% reduction in the mean value of anti TPO antibody level. Difference of mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/mL) was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). In the placebo group the mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) (mean +- s.d.) of patients was 686.97+- 290.19 and after 8 weeks of placebo the mean value was 573.1 +- 254.09. So, in the placebo group the reduction is only 16.5%. Difference of mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Therefore, in line with the hypothesis the data contributes clearer understanding that vitamin D supplementation results in a reduction of thyroid autoimmunity. This result also supports the previous research. Simsek et al. prospectively evaluated 82 patients with HT randomized in two groups: the first group treated with cholecalciferol for one month and the second group without vitamin D replacement. Their results showed that TPO Ab and Tg Ab levels were significantly decreased by the vitamin D replacement therapy in the first group [46]. These findings were also confirmed by other prospective studies and randomized controlled trials.[9-11] So, the result of our study clearly indicates that vitamin D supplementation could exert a positive effect on thyroid function as well as thyroid autoimmunity Limitations: Vitamin D status is not measured at the end of 8 weeks because of economic constraints. So, it is difficult to determine the optimal level of vitamin D needed for improving the evolution of this immunological disorder. Cholecalciferol is used in HT patients in our study, although active form calcitriol might be more beneficial as vitamin D binding protein level may affect the conversion of inactive vitamin D form and thus alters its function on immune cells. HT patients with normal vitamin D level have been excluded from the study, so from our study we cannot comment on beneficial effect of vit D supplementation in HT patient with normal vit D level. As we used empiric dose of levothyroxine in both the groups instead of a fixed dose, we could not analyze the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in reduction of serum TSH in HT There is still a gap in the knowledge regarding the potential of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of HT patients whether vitamin D supplementation will help in decreasing the replacement dose of levothyroxine or whether it will stop the need of levothyroxine replacement if used in early stages of HT. CONCLUSIONS: The 8 weeks randomized; double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrates a negative correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D vs anti TPO antibody level. Treatment with 60,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for 8 weeks, is associated with significant decrease in antithyroid antibody titers. It also improved serum TSH level compared with the placebo, i.e. supplementary treatment with cholecalciferol seems to have beneficial effects on AITD. However, large multicentre studies are needed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementary treatment on meaningful long-term clinical end points in AITD. References Dana L.

38553695 | Mice lacking DIO3 exhibit sex-specific alterations in circadian patterns of corticosterone and gene expression in metabolic tissues. Disruption of circadian rhythms is associated with neurological, endocrine and metabolic pathologies. We have recently shown that mice lacking functional type 3 deiodinase (DIO3), the enzyme that clears thyroid hormones, exhibit a phase shift in locomotor activity, suggesting altered circadian rhythm. To better understand the physiological and molecular basis of this phenotype, we used Dio3+/+ and Dio3-/- mice of both sexes at different zeitgeber times (ZTs) and analyzed corticosterone and thyroxine (T4) levels, hypothalamic, hepatic, and adipose tissue expression of clock genes, as well as genes involved in the thyroid hormone action or physiology of liver and adipose tissues. Wild type mice exhibited sexually dimorphic circadian patterns of genes controlling thyroid hormone action, including Dio3. Dio3-/- mice exhibited altered hypothalamic expression of several clock genes at ZT12, but did not disrupt the overall circadian profile. Expression of clock genes in peripheral tissues was not disrupted by Dio3 deficiency. However, Dio3 loss in liver and adipose tissues disrupted circadian profiles of genes that determine tissue thyroid hormone action and physiology. We also observed circadian-specific changes in serum T4 and corticosterone as a result of DIO3 deficiency. The circadian alterations manifested sexual dimorphism. Most notable, the time curve of serum corticosterone was flattened in Dio3-/- females. We conclude that Dio3 exhibits circadian variations, influencing the circadian rhythmicity of thyroid hormone action and physiology in liver and adipose tissues in a sex-specific manner. Circadian disruptions in tissue physiology may then contribute to the metabolic phenotypes of DIO3-deficient mice.
38604686 | [Effect of LAG3 deficiency on natural killer cell function and hepatic fibrosis in mice infected with Echinococcus multilocularis]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of LAG-3 deficiency (LAG3-/-) on natural killer (NK) cell function and hepatic fibrosis in mice infected with Echinococcus multilocularis. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, each weighing (20 +- 2) g, were divided into the LAG3-/- and wild type (WT) groups, and each mouse in both groups was inoculated with 3 000 E. multilocularis protoscoleces via the hepatic portal vein. Mouse liver and spleen specimens were collected 12 weeks post-infection, sectioned and stained with sirius red, and the hepatic lesions and fibrosis were observed. Mouse hepatic and splenic lymphocytes were isolated, and flow cytometry was performed to detect the proportions of hepatic and splenic NK cells, the expression of CD44, CD25 and CD69 molecules on NK cell surface, and the secretion of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10 and IL-17A. RESULTS: Sirius red staining showed widening of inflammatory cell bands and hyperplasia of fibrotic connective tissues around mouse hepatic lesions, as well as increased deposition of collagen fibers in the LAG3-/-group relative to the WT group. Flow cytometry revealed lower proportions of mouse hepatic (6.29% +- 1.06% vs. 11.91% +- 1.85%, P < 0.000 1) and splenic NK cells (4.44% +- 1.22% vs. 5.85% +- 1.10%, P > 0.05) in the LAG3-/- group than in the WT group, and the mean fluorescence intensity of CD44 was higher on the surface of mouse hepatic NK cells in the LAG3-/- group than in the WT group (t = -3.234, P < 0.01), while no significant differences were found in the mean fluorescence intensity of CD25 or CD69 on the surface of mouse hepaticNK cells between the LAG3-/- and WT groups (both P values > 0.05). There were significant differences between the LAG3-/- and WT groups in terms of the percentages of IFN-gamma (t = -0.723, P > 0.05), TNF-alpha (t = -0.659, P > 0.05), IL-4 (t = -0.263, P > 0.05), IL-10 (t = -0.455, P > 0.05) or IL-17A secreted by mouse hepatic NK cells (t = 0.091, P > 0.05), and the percentage of IFN-gamma secreted by mouse splenic NK cells was higher in the LAG3-/- group than in the WT group (58.40% +- 1.64% vs. 50.40% +- 4.13%; t = -4.042, P < 0.01); however, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the proportions of TNF-alpha (t = -1.902, P > 0.05), IL-4 (t = -1.333, P > 0.05), IL-10 (t = -1.356, P > 0.05) or IL-17A secreted by mouse splenic NK cells (t = 0.529, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the course of E. multilocularis infections, LAG3-/- promotes high-level secretion of IFN-gamma by splenic NK cells, which may participate in the reversal the immune function of NK cells, resulting in aggravation of hepatic fibrosis.
38636997 | [Study on liver tissue derived-extracellular vesicles regulating the osteogenic differentiation ability of mesenchymal stem cells and promoting the healing of jaw bone defects]. Objective: To explore the biological process of liver tissue-derived extracellular vesicle (LT-EV) in promoting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and healing of jaw defects to provide a feasible treatment method for the clinical treatment of jaw bone defects. Methods: Enzymatic hydrolysis and differential centrifugation were used to extract LT-EV, scanning electron microscopy, Western blotting, and nanoparticle tracking analyzers were used to identify and characterize LT-EV, and further to explore the biological functions of LT-EV through proteomics and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Flow cytometry was used to detect LT-EV plasma concentration and to calculate the plasma half-life of LT-EV. Small animal in vivo imaging system was used to detect the biological distribution of LT-EV 24 hours after injection. Six C57BL/6 mice were divided into control group and LT-EV group (3 mice in each group) by simple random sampling method. All mice underwent jaw bone defect surgery and tail vein injection every 7 days (the control group was injected with phosphoric buffer saline, LT-EV group was injected with LT-EV), micro-CT was used to evaluate the degree of mouse jaw bone healing 28 days after surgery, HE staining was used to analyze the multi-organ biosafety of LT-EV, and immunofluorescence staining was used to detect the jaw bone expression of osteogenic marker proteins in the defect area. Human jaw bone mesenchymal stem cells (hJBMSC) induced by osteogenic differentiation were treated with LT-EV (obtained from orthognathic surgery patients provided by the Department of Traumatology and Orthognathic Surgery of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Air Force Medical University resected normal jaw bone fragments), and the difference in osteogenic differentiation ability between the hJBMSC group and the control group (phosphate buffer saline treatment) was compared, and the in vitro bone differentiation promoting effect of LT-EV was verified through alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: The yield of LT-EV was high, and proteomics and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed that LT-EV contained a series of proteins that regulated cell biological functions. LT-EV injected into the tail vein could reach the mouse jaw bone defect area and promote the regeneration and repair of the jaw bone defect [the bone volume fractions of the LT-EV group and the control group were (36.06+-4.20)% and (18.58+-5.61)%, respectively; t=4.32, P=0.013], and had good biosafety. LT-EV could promote osteogenic differentiation of hJBMSC in vitro. Compared to the control group, ALP staining and osteogenic gene expression levels were significantly enhanced after osteogenic differentiation of hJBMSC (P<0.05). Conclusions: LT-EV exhibits a high yield, ease of acquisition, high biological safety, and excellent bone-promoting effects. It holds promise as a novel cell-free therapy strategy for regenerating craniofacial bone defects.
25587856 | H5N1 Virus Hemagglutinin Inhibition of cAMP-Dependent CFTR via TLR4-Mediated Janus Tyrosine Kinase 3 Activation Exacerbates Lung Inflammation. The host tolerance mechanisms to avian influenza virus (H5N1) infection that limit tissue injury remain unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-dependent Cl(-) channel, modulates airway inflammation. Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 3, a JAK family member that plays a central role in inflammatory responses, prominently contributes to the dysregulated innate immune response upon H5N1 attachment; therefore, this study aims to elucidate whether JAK3 activation induced by H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA) inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR channels. We performed short-circuit current, immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses of the airway epithelium in Jak3(+/+) and Jak3(+/-) mice. We demonstrate that H5N1 HA attachment inhibits cAMP-dependent CFTR Cl(-) channels via JAK3-mediated adenylyl cyclase (AC) suppression, which reduces cAMP production. This inhibition leads to increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling and inflammatory responses. H5N1 HA is detected by TLR4 expressed on respiratory epithelial cells, facilitating JAK3 activation. This activation induces the interaction between TLR4 and Galphai protein, which blocks ACs. Our findings provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of acute lung injury via the inhibition of cAMP-dependent CFTR channels, indicating that the administration of cAMP-elevating agents and targeting JAK3 may activate host tolerance to infection for the management of influenza virus-induced fatal pneumonia. 
27389192 | Activation of the IL-2 Receptor in Podocytes: A Potential Mechanism for Podocyte Injury in Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome? The renal podocyte plays an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane. We have previously reported that patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) have increased IL-2 production. We hypothesized that podocytes express an IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) and signaling through this receptor can result in podocyte injury. To confirm the presence of the IL-2R, we tested a conditionally immortalized murine podocyte cell line by flow cytometry, qPCR, and Western blot. To test for the presence of the IL-2R in vivo, immunohistochemical staining was performed on human renal biopsies in children with FSGS and control. Podocytes were stimulated with IL-2 in vitro, to study signaling events via the JAK/STAT pathway. The results showed that stimulation with IL-2 resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of STAT 5a, phosphorylated STAT 5, JAK 3, and phosphorylated JAK 3. We then investigated for signs of cellular injury and the data showed that pro-apoptotic markers Bax and cFLIP were significantly increased following IL-2 exposure, whereas LC3 II was decreased. Furthermore, mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis were both significantly increased following activation of the IL-2R. We used a paracellular permeability assay to monitor the structural integrity of a podocyte monolayer following IL-2 exposure. The results showed that podocytes exposed to IL-2 have increased albumin leakage across the monolayer. We conclude that murine podocytes express the IL-2R, and that activation through the IL-2R results in podocyte injury. 
36201890 | IL-7: Comprehensive review. OVERVIEW: IL-7 is a member of the family of cytokines with four anti-parallel alpha helixes that bind Type I cytokine receptors. It is produced by stromal cells and is required for development and homeostatic survival of lymphoid cells. GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE: Interleukin 7 (IL7) human IL7: gene ID: 3574 on ch 8; murine Il7 gene ID: 16,196 on ch 3. PROTEIN: Precursor contains a signal sequence, mature human IL-7 peptide 152aa, predicted 17.4kd peptide, glycosylated resulting in 25kd. Crystal structure: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/3DI2. REGULATION OF IL-7 PRODUCTION: Major producers are stromal cells in thymus, bone marrow and lymphoid organs but also reported in other tissues. Production is primarily constitutive but reported to be affected by IFNgamma and other factors. IL-7 RECEPTORS: Two chains IL-7Ralpha (IL-7R) and gammac (IL-2RG). Human IL-7R: gene ID 3575 on ch 5; human IL2RG: gene ID 3561 on ch X; mouse IL-7R: gene ID 16,197 on ch 15; murine Il2rg gene ID 16,186 on ch X. Member of gammac family of receptors for cytokines IL-2, -4, -9, -15, and -21. Primarily expressed on lymphocytes but reports of other cell types. Expression in T-cells downregulated by IL-7. Low expression on Tregs, no expression on mature B-cells. Crystal structure: http://www.rcsb.org/structure/3DI2. IL-7 RECEPTOR SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS: Major signals through JAK1, JAK3 to STAT5 and through non-canonical STAT3, STAT1, PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways. BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF IL-7: Required for survival of immature thymocytes, naive T-cells, memory T-cells, pro-B-cells and innate lymphocytes. Pharmacological treatment with IL-7 induces expansion of naive and memory T-cells and pro-B-cells. ABNORMALITIES OF THE IL-7 PATHWAY IN DISEASE: Deficiencies in the IL-7 pathway in humans and mice result in severe combined immunodeficiency due to lymphopenia. Excessive signaling of the pathway in mice drives autoimmune diseases and in humans is associated with autoimmune syndromes including multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, atopic dermatitis and asthma. Mutations in the IL-7 receptor pathway drive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CLINICAL APPLICATIONS: IL-7 has been evaluated in patients with cancer and shown to expand lymphocytes. It accelerated lymphocyte recovery after hematopoietic stem cell transfer, and increased lymphocyte counts in AIDS patients and sepsis patients. Monoclonal antibodies blocking the IL-7 receptor are being evaluated in autoimmune diseases. Cytotoxic monoclonals are being evaluated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs blocking the signal transduction pathway are being tested in autoimmunity and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
36330983 | Cadmium impairs the development of natural killer cells and bidirectionally modifies their capacity for cytotoxicity. Cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal in the environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Cd on natural killer (NK) cells. C57BL/6 mice were treated with 10 ppm Cd via drinking water for 3 months, and the development of NK cells in the bone marrow (BM) and the cytotoxicity of mature NK (mNK) cells in the peripheral immune organs were evaluated thereafter; the impact of Cd on the cytotoxicity of mNK cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was also investigated. Whereas Cd treatment impaired the differentiation of NK progenitors in the BM, Cd treatment activated the JAK3/STAT5 signaling to drive the proliferation of mNK cells and thereby lead to a compensation increase of mNK cells in the peripheral immune organs of mice. Additionally, Cd treatment bidirectionally regulated the cytotoxicity of mouse mNK cells to differential tumor cells, dependent on the levels of Fas expression in the tumor cells; mechanically, Cd treatment activated the JAK3/STAT5 signaling to promote the expression of FasL in mNK cells to increase their cytotoxicity, while Cd treatment reduced the expression of granzyme B in mNK cells to impair their cytotoxicity in the peripheral immune organs of mice. Likewise, in vitro assays indicated that Cd treatment also activated the JAK3/STAT5 signaling to increase the expression of FasL, whereas Cd treatment reduced the expression of granzyme B in human mNK cells. Thus Cd treatment impaired the development of NK cells in the BM and bidirectionally regulated the cytotoxicity of mNK cells in the peripheral immune organs, which may extend our current understanding for the immunotoxicity of Cd.
36396110 | CCL2-targeted ginkgolic acid exerts anti-glioblastoma effects by inhibiting the JAK3-STAT1/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. AIMS: Glioblastoma (GBM) with aggressive nature and poor prognosis has become the most common intracranial tumor. Most clinical chemotherapeutic drugs fail to achieve the anticipated therapeutic outcome. This study identified the anti-GBM effects of ginkgolic acids (GAs) and elucidated the potential molecular mechanisms, exploiting the significant antitumor effects of GAs, which are widely present in the outer bark of Ginkgo biloba. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two GBM cell lines, U251 and T98G, were selected for in vitro experiments to evaluate the antitumor effects of GA. Cell viability and proliferation were examined by MTT and colony formation assay. The effect of GA on apoptosis and the cell cycle was examined by flow cytometry. Scratch and Transwell assays reflected the migration and invasion ability. The molecular mechanisms were explored by using immunoblot analysis, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In the nude mouse transplantation tumor model, preclinical treatment effects were assessed by ultrasound and MRI. KEY FINDINGS: The present study showed that GA inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, stemness, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GBM cells and induced apoptosis by inhibiting CCL2, affecting the JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, and inhibiting the EMT regulators Snail and Slug. Finally, GA showed significant control of tumors in a GBM xenograft model. SIGNIFICANCE: GA inhibits the progression of GBM cells by targeting CCL2, affecting the JAK-STAT and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways, and inhibiting the EMT regulators Snail and Slug. The outstanding antitumor properties of GA provide a novel strategy for the GBM therapy.
36575861 | A novel cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mouse model for hepatitis virus infection and reconstruction of human immune system. Although human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice support infection with hepatitis viruses, these mice fail to develop viral hepatitis due to the lack of an adaptive immune system. In this study, we generated new immunodeficiency cDNA-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice and established a mouse model with both a humanized liver and immune system. Transplantation of human hepatocytes with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A24 resulted in establishment of a highly replaced liver in cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice. These mice were successfully infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) for a prolonged period and facilitate analysis of the effect of anti-HCV drugs. Administration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from an HLA-A24 donor resulted in establishment of 22.6%-81.3% human CD45-positive mononuclear cell chimerism in liver-infiltrating cells without causing graft-versus-host disease in cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mice without human hepatocyte transplantation. When mice were transplanted with human hepatocytes and then administered HLA-A24-positive human PBMCs, an alloimmune response between transplanted human hepatocytes and PBMCs occurred, with production of transplanted hepatocyte-specific anti-HLA antibody. In conclusion, we succeeded in establishing a humanized liver/immune system characterized by an allo-reaction between transplanted human immune cells and human liver using a novel cDNA-uPA/SCID/Rag2-/- /Jak3-/- mouse. This mouse model can be used to generate a chronic hepatitis mouse model with a human immune system with application not only to hepatitis virus virology but also to investigation of the pathology of post-transplantation liver rejection.
36644879 | CD27-Expressing Xenoantigen-Expanded Human Regulatory T Cells Are Efficient in Suppressing Xenogeneic Immune Response. Clinically, xenotransplantation often leads to T-cell-mediated graft rejection. Immunosuppressive agents including polyclonal regulatory T cells (poly-Tregs) promote global immunosuppression, resulting in serious infections and malignancies in patients. Xenoantigen-expanded Tregs (xeno-Tregs) have become a promising immune therapy strategy to protect xenografts with fewer side effects. In this study, we aimed to identify an efficient and stable subset of xeno-Tregs. We enriched CD27+ xeno-Tregs using cell sorting and evaluated their suppressive functions and stability in vitro via mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), real-time polymerase chain reaction, inflammatory induction assay, and Western blotting. A STAT5 inhibitor was used to investigate the relationship between the function and stability of CD27+ xeno-Tregs and the JAK3-STAT5 signaling pathway. A humanized xenotransplanted mouse model was used to evaluate the function of CD27+ xeno-Tregs in vivo. Our results show that CD27+ xeno-Tregs express higher levels of Foxp3, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA4), and Helios and lower levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17) than their CD27- counterparts. In addition, CD27+ xeno-Tregs showed enhanced suppressive function in xeno-MLR at ratios of 1:4 and 1:16 of Tregs:responder cells. Under inflammatory conditions, a lower percentage of CD27+ xeno-Tregs secretes IL-17 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). CD27+ xeno-Tregs demonstrated an upregulated JAK3-STAT5 pathway compared with that of CD27- xeno-Tregs and showed decreased Foxp3, Helios, and CTLA4 expression after addition of STAT5 inhibitor. Mice that received porcine skin grafts showed a normal tissue phenotype and less leukocyte infiltration after reconstitution with CD27+ xeno-Tregs. Taken together, these data indicate that CD27+ xeno-Tregs may suppress immune responses in a xenoantigen-specific manner, which might be related to the activation of the JAK3-STAT5 signaling pathway.
37021816 | Integrative single-cell sequencing analysis distinguishes survival-associated cells from the breast cancer microenvironment. BACKGROUND: Breast cancer shows a highly complex tumor microenvironment by containing various cell types. Identifying prognostic cell populations in the tumor microenvironment will improve the mechanistical understanding of breast cancer and facilitate the development of new breast cancer therapies by targeting the tumor microenvironment. The development of single-cell sequencing reveals various cell types, states, and lineages within the context of heterogenous breast tumors, but identifying phenotype-associated subpopulations is challenging. RESULTS: Here, we applied Scissor (single-cell identification of subpopulations with bulk Sample phenotype correlation) to integrate single cell and bulk data of breast cancer, and found that MHC-deficient tumor cells, FABP5+ macrophages, and COL1A1+ cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were detrimental to patient survival, while T cells and dendritic cells were the main protective cells. MHC-deficient tumor cells show strong downregulation of MHC expression for immune evasion by downregulating interferon and JAK-STATs signaling. FABP5+ macrophages show low antigen-presenting activity via associating with lipid metabolism. Our data suggest that COL1A1+ CAFs may block T-cell immune infiltration through cell interaction in breast tumor microenvironment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our study reveals survival-associated subpopulations in breast tumor microenvironment. Importantly, subpopulations related to immune evasion of breast cancer is uncovered.
37062030 | High Expression of MHC Class I Overcomes Cancer Immunotherapy Resistance Due to IFNgamma Signaling Pathway Defects. IFNgamma signaling pathway defects are well-known mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, conflicting data have been reported, and the detailed mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors owing to IFNgamma signaling pathway defects may be primarily caused by reduced MHC-I expression rather than by the loss of inhibitory effects on cellular proliferation or decreased chemokine production. In particular, we found that chemokines that recruit effector T cells were mainly produced by immune cells rather than cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment of a mouse model, with defects in IFNgamma signaling pathways. Furthermore, we found a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in a patient with JAK-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma whose HLA-I expression level was maintained. In addition, CRISPR screening to identify molecules associated with elevated MHC-I expression independent of IFNgamma signaling pathways demonstrated that guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma 4 (GNG4) maintained MHC-I expression via the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Our results indicate that patients with IFNgamma signaling pathway defects are not always resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors and highlight the importance of MHC-I expression among the pathways and the possibility of NF-kappaB-targeted therapies to overcome such resistance.
37115711 | The VEGFR/PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ABT-869, blocks necroptosis by targeting RIPK1 kinase. Necroptosis is a mode of programmed, lytic cell death that is executed by the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pseudokinase following activation by the upstream kinases, receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase (RIPK)-1 and RIPK3. Dysregulated necroptosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many human diseases, including inflammatory and degenerative conditions, infectious diseases and cancers, provoking interest in pharmacological targeting of the pathway. To identify small molecules impacting on the necroptotic machinery, we performed a phenotypic screen using a mouse cell line expressing an MLKL mutant that kills cells in the absence of upstream death or pathogen detector receptor activation. This screen identified the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ABT-869 (Linifanib), as a small molecule inhibitor of necroptosis. We applied a suite of cellular, biochemical and biophysical analyses to pinpoint the apical necroptotic kinase, RIPK1, as the target of ABT-869 inhibition. Our study adds to the repertoire of established protein kinase inhibitors that additionally target RIPK1 and raises the prospect that serendipitous targeting of necroptosis signalling may contribute to their clinical efficacy in some settings.
37126006 | Uncoupling CD4+ TIL-mediated tumor killing from JAK-signaling in melanoma. INTRODUCTION: Impaired MHCI-presentation and insensitivity to immune effector molecules are common features of immune checkpoint blockade(ICB)-resistant tumors and can be respectively associated with loss of beta2 microglobulin(B2M) or impaired IFNgamma-signaling. Patients with ICB-resistant tumors can respond to alternative immunotherapies, such as infusion of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes(TILs). CD4+ T cells can exert cytotoxic functions against tumor cells; however, it is unclear whether CD4+ T cell responses can be exploited to improve the clinical outcomes of patients affected by ICB-resistant tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we exploited CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to reproduce immune-resistant tumor phenotypes via gene knockout(KO). To determine the role of cytotoxic CD4+ TILs in ICB-resistant tumors, we investigated CD4+ TIL-mediated cytotoxicity in matched pairs of TILs and autologous melanoma cell lines, used as a model of patient-specific immune-tumor interaction. Around 40% of melanomas constitutively express MHC Class II molecules; hence melanomas with or without natural constitutive MHC Class II expression(MHCIIconst+ or MHCIIconst-) were employed. RESULTS: CD4+ TIL-mediated cytotoxicity was not affected by B2M loss but was dependent on the expression of CIITA. MHCIIconst+ melanomas were killed by tumor-specific CD4+ TILs even in the absence of IFNgamma-mediated MHCII upregulation, whereas IFNgamma was necessary for CD4+ TIL-mediated cytotoxicity against MHCIIconst- melanomas. Notably, while tumor-specific CD4+ TILs did not kill JAK1KO MHCIIconst- melanomas even post IFNgamma stimulation, sensitivity toCD4+ TIL-mediated cytotoxicity was maintained by JAK1KO MHCIIconst+ melanomas. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data indicate that exploiting tumor-specific cytotoxic CD4+ TILs could help overcome resistance to ICB mediated by IFNgamma-signaling loss in MHCIIconst+ melanomas.
37164948 | Phase II trial of neoadjuvant sitravatinib plus nivolumab in patients undergoing nephrectomy for locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Sitravatinib is an immunomodulatory tyrosine kinase inhibitor that can augment responses when combined with programmed death-1 inhibitors such as nivolumab. We report a single-arm, interventional, phase 2 study of neoadjuvant sitravatinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with locally advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) prior to curative nephrectomy (NCT03680521). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) prior to surgery with a null hypothesis ORR = 5% and the alternative hypothesis set at ORR = 30%. Secondary endpoints were safety; pharmacokinetics (PK) of sitravatinib; immune effects, including changes in programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression; time-to-surgery; and disease-free survival (DFS). Twenty patients were evaluable for safety and 17 for efficacy. The ORR was 11.8%, and 24-month DFS probability was 88 0% (95% CI 61.0 to 97.0). There were no grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse events. Sitravatinib PK did not change following the addition of nivolumab. Correlative blood and tissue analyses showed changes in the tumour microenvironment resulting in an immunologically active tumour by the time of surgery (median time-to-surgery: 50 days). The primary endpoint of this study was not met as short-term neoadjuvant sitravatinib and nivolumab did not substantially increase ORR.
37219765 | Endothelial extracellular vesicles induce acute lung injury via follistatin-like protein 1. Cardiopulmonary bypass has been speculated to elicit systemic inflammation to initiate acute lung injury (ALI), including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), in patients after cardiac surgery. We previously found that post-operative patients showed an increase in endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (eEVs) with components of coagulation and acute inflammatory responses. However, the mechanism underlying the onset of ALI owing to the release of eEVs after cardiopulmonary bypass, remains unclear. Plasma plasminogen-activated inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and eEV levels were measured in patients with cardiopulmonary bypass. Endothelial cells and mice (C57BL/6, Toll-like receptor 4 knockout (TLR4-/-) and inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout (iNOS-/-)) were challenged with eEVs isolated from PAI-1-stimulated endothelial cells. Plasma PAI-1 and eEVs were remarkably enhanced after cardiopulmonary bypass. Plasma PAI-1 elevation was positively correlated with the increase in eEVs. The increase in plasma PAI-1 and eEV levels was associated with post-operative ARDS. The eEVs derived from PAI-1-stimulated endothelial cells could recognize TLR4 to stimulate a downstream signaling cascade identified as the Janus kinase 2/3 (JAK2/3)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) pathway, along with iNOS induction, and cytokine/chemokine production in vascular endothelial cells and C57BL/6 mice, ultimately contributing to ALI. ALI could be attenuated by JAK2/3 or STAT3 inhibitors (AG490 or S3I-201, respectively), and was relieved in TLR4-/- and iNOS-/- mice. eEVs activate the TLR4/JAK3/STAT3/IRF-1 signaling pathway to induce ALI/ARDS by delivering follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1), and FSTL1 knockdown in eEVs alleviates eEV-induced ALI/ARDS. Our data thus demonstrate that cardiopulmonary bypass may increase plasma PAI-1 levels to induce FSTL1-enriched eEVs, which target the TLR4-mediated JAK2/3/STAT3/IRF-1 signaling cascade and form a positive feedback loop, leading to ALI/ARDS after cardiac surgery. Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for ALI/ARDS after cardiac surgery.
37325444 | Selective Inhibitors of Janus Kinase 3 Modify Responses to Lipopolysaccharides by Increasing the Interleukin-10-to-Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha Ratio. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors act at low doses (e.g., tofacitinib, 0.2-0.4 mumol/kg bid) in clinical use, suggesting an efficient underlying mode of action. We hypothesized that their effectiveness is due to their ability to raise the ratio of IL-10 to TNFalpha. Unlike other JAK isoforms, JAK3 is expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells and is essential for immune function. We used JAK3 selective inhibitors with preferential distribution to immune cells. Inhibition of JAK3 in human leukocytes reduced TNFalpha and IL-6 but maintained levels of IL-10, while pan-JAK inhibitors increased TNFalpha, IL-6, and IL-10. JAK1 is required for IL-10 receptor signaling, which suggests that, at exposure above the IC50 (55 nM for tofacitinib on JAK1), there is less feedback control of TNFalpha levels. This leads to self-limiting effects of JAK1 inhibitors and could place an upper limit on appropriate doses. In vivo, treating mice with JAK3 inhibitors before LPS administration decreased plasma TNFalpha and increased IL-10 above vehicle levels, suggesting that JAK3 inhibition may limit TNFalpha release by increasing IL-10 while leaving the IL-10 receptor functional. This mechanism should have general utility in controlling autoimmune diseases and can be conveniently observed by measuring the ratio of IL-10 to TNFalpha. In summary, our targeted, \leukotropic\ inhibitors more effectively increased IL-10/TNFalpha ratios than unselective control compounds and could, therefore, be ideal for autoimmune therapy.
37352370 | Genetic regulators of sputum mucin concentration and their associations with COPD phenotypes. Hyper-secretion and/or hyper-concentration of mucus is a defining feature of multiple obstructive lung diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mucus itself is composed of a mixture of water, ions, salt and proteins, of which the gel-forming mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B, are the most abundant. Recent studies have linked the concentrations of these proteins in sputum to COPD phenotypes, including chronic bronchitis (CB) and acute exacerbations (AE). We sought to determine whether common genetic variants influence sputum mucin concentrations and whether these variants are also associated with COPD phenotypes, specifically CB and AE. We performed a GWAS to identify quantitative trait loci for sputum mucin protein concentration (pQTL) in the Sub-Populations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS, n = 708 for total mucin, n = 215 for MUC5AC, MUC5B). Subsequently, we tested for associations of mucin pQTL with CB and AE using regression modeling (n = 822-1300). Replication analysis was conducted using data from COPDGene (n = 5740) and by examining results from the UK Biobank. We identified one genome-wide significant pQTL for MUC5AC (rs75401036) and two for MUC5B (rs140324259, rs10001928). The strongest association for MUC5B, with rs140324259 on chromosome 11, explained 14% of variation in sputum MUC5B. Despite being associated with lower MUC5B, the C allele of rs140324259 conferred increased risk of CB (odds ratio (OR) = 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.80) as well as AE ascertained over three years of follow up (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.02-1.94). Associations between rs140324259 and CB or AE did not replicate in COPDGene. However, in the UK Biobank, rs140324259 was associated with phenotypes that define CB, namely chronic mucus production and cough, again with the C allele conferring increased risk. We conclude that sputum MUC5AC and MUC5B concentrations are associated with common genetic variants, and the top locus for MUC5B may influence COPD phenotypes, in particular CB.
37466915 | Ketogenic diet attenuates neuroinflammation and induces conversion of M1 microglia to M2 in an EAE model of multiple sclerosis by regulating the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway and inhibiting HDAC3 and P2X7R activation. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by demyelination and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system (CNS); severe symptoms lead MS patients to use complementary treatments. Ketogenic diet (KD) shows wide neuroprotective effects, but the precise mechanisms underlying the therapeutic activity of KD in MS are unclear. The present study established a continuous 24 days experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model with or without KD. The changes in motor function, pathological hallmarks of EAE, the status of microglia, neuroinflammatory response and intracellular signaling pathways in mice were detected by the rotarod test, histological analysis, real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Our results showed that KD could prevent motor deficiency, reduce clinical scores, inhibit demyelination, improve pathological lesions and suppress microglial activation in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Meanwhile, KD shifted microglial polarization toward the protective M2 phenotype and modified the inflammatory milieu by downregulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6, as well as upregulating the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-beta. Furthermore, KD decreased the expression levels of CCL2, CCR2, CCL3, CCR1, CCR5, CXCL10 and CXCR3 in the spinal cord and spleen with reduced monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the CNS. In addition, KD inhibits NLRP3 activation in the microglia, as revealed by the significantly decreased co-expression of NLRP3+ and Iba-1+ in the KD + EAE group. Further studies demonstrated that KD suppresses inflammatory response and M1 microglial polarization by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway, the JAK1/STAT1 pathway, HDAC3 and P2X7R activation, as well as up-regulation of JAK3/STAT6.
37662900 | Metabolic signature and proteasome activity controls synovial migration of CDC42hiCD14+ cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Objective: Activation of Rho-GTPases in macrophages causes inflammation and severe arthritis in mice. In this study, we explore if Rho-GTPases define the joint destination of pathogenic leukocytes, the mechanism by which they perpetuate rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and how JAK inhibition mitigates these effects. Methods: CD14+ cells of 136 RA patients were characterized by RNA sequencing and cytokine measurement to identify biological processes and transcriptional regulators specific for CDC42 hiCD14+ cells, which were summarized in a metabolic signature (MetSig). The effect of hypoxia and IFN-gamma signaling on the metabolic signature of CD14+ cells was assessed experimentally. To investigate its connection with joint inflammation, the signature was translated into the single-cell characteristics of CDC42 hi synovial tissue macrophages. The sensitivity of MetSig to the RA disease activity and the treatment effect were assessed experimentally and clinically. Results: CDC42 hiCD14+ cells carried MetSig of genes functional in the oxidative phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent cell remodeling, which correlated with the cytokine-rich migratory phenotype and antigen-presenting capacity of these cells. Integration of CDC42 hiCD14+ and synovial macrophages marked with MetSig revealed the important role of the interferon-rich environment and immunoproteasome expression in the homeostasis of these pathogenic macrophages. The CDC42 hiCD14+ cells were targeted by JAK inhibitors and responded with the downregulation of immunoproteasome and MHC-II molecules, which disintegrated the immunological synapse, reduced cytokine production, and alleviated arthritis. Conclusion: This study shows that the CDC42-related MetSig identifies the antigen-presenting CD14+ cells that migrate to joints to coordinate autoimmunity. The accumulation of CDC42 hiCD14+ cells discloses patients perceptive to the JAKi treatment.
37671865 | Intertumoral heterogeneity impacts oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus efficacy in mouse pancreatic cancer cells. Oncolytic virus (OV) therapy is a promising virus-based approach against various malignancies, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our previous studies demonstrated that human PDAC cell lines are highly variable in their permissiveness to OVs. Mouse PDAC cell lines, which are widely used for in vivo examination of the adaptive immune responses during OV and other cancer therapies, have never been examined systematically for the impact of intertumoral heterogeneity (the differences observed between tumors in different patients) on OV virus efficacy. Here, we examined phenotypically and genotypically three commonly used allograftable mouse PDAC cell lines (C57BL6 genetic background): Panc02 (derived from chemically induced PDAC; also known as Pan02), and two cell lines originated from PDACs developed in two different KPC (KrasG12D, Trp53R172H, and PDX-1-Cre) mouse models. Our study (i) characterized the ability of a widely used attenuated oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus VSV-DeltaM51-GFP to infect, replicate in, and kill mouse PDAC cells; (ii) examined their innate antiviral responses; (iii) compared their permissiveness to a non-attenuated VSV-Mwt-GFP and chemotherapeutic drugs; and (iv) analyzed their karyotype and exome. Mouse PDAC cell lines showed high divergence in their permissiveness to VSV-DeltaM51-GFP, which negatively correlated with their abilities to mount innate antiviral responses, while all three cell lines were highly permissive to VSV-Mwt-GFP. No correlation was found between resistance to VSV-DeltaM51-GFP and chemotherapy. Also, mouse PDAC cell lines showed high divergence in their karyotype and exome. The exome analysis demonstrated that more VSV-DeltaM51-GFP-permissive mouse PDAC cell lines harbor mutations in multiple important antiviral genes, such as TYK2, JAK2, and JAK3. IMPORTANCE Oncolytic virus (OV) therapy is a promising virus-based approach against various malignancies, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our previous studies using various human PDAC cell lines demonstrated that they are highly variable in their permissiveness to OVs. In this study, we examined phenotypically and genotypically three commonly used allograftable mouse PDAC cell lines, which are widely used for in vivo examination of the adaptive immune responses during cancer therapies. Mouse PDAC cell lines showed high divergence in their permissiveness to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which negatively correlated with their abilities to mount innate antiviral responses. Also, we discovered that more VSV-permissive mouse PDAC cell lines harbor mutations in multiple important antiviral genes, such as TYK2, JAK2, and JAK3. Our study provides essential information about three model mouse PDAC cell lines and proposes a novel platform to study OV-based therapies against different PDACs in immunocompetent mice.
37821072 | Profiling of mouse and human liver diseases identifies targets for therapeutic treatment of autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are chronic liver diseases (CLDs) of distinct etiologies that represent a public health risk with limited therapeutic options. A common feature among CLDs is an aggressive T cell response resulting in destruction of liver tissue and fibrosis. Here, we assessed the presence and nature of T cell inflammation in late-stage human AIH, PSC and NASH and examined whether targeting the T cell response can improve disease pathology in a mouse model (Traf6DeltaTEC) of spontaneous AIH. T cell infiltration and ensuing inflammatory pathways were present in human AIH and PSC and to a lesser extent in NASH. However, we observed qualitative differences in infiltrating T cell subsets and upregulation of inflammatory pathways among these diseases, while mouse and human AIH exhibited similar immunogenic signatures. While gene expression profiles differed among diseases, we identified 52 genes commonly upregulated across all diseases that included the JAK3 tyrosine kinase. Therapeutic targeting of chronic AIH with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib reduced hepatic T cell infiltration, AIH histopathology and associated immune parameters in treated Traf6DeltaTEC mice. Our results indicate that targeting T cell responses in established hepatic autoimmune inflammation is a feasible strategy for developing novel therapeutic approaches to treat AIH and possibly other CLDs irrespective of etiology.
37830594 | New JAK3-INSL3 Fusion Transcript-An Oncogenic Event in Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma. Constitutively activated tyrosine kinase JAK3 is implicated in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). The mechanisms of constitutive JAK3 activation are unknown although a JAK3 mutation was reported in a small portion of CTCL patients. In this study, we assessed the oncogenic roles of a newly identified JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript in CTCL. Total RNA from malignant T-cells in 33 patients with Sezary syndrome (SS), a leukemic form of CTCL, was examined for the new JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript by RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. The expression levels were assessed by qPCR and correlated with patient survivals. Knockdown and/or knockout assays were conducted in two CTCL cell lines (MJ cells and HH cells) by RNA interference and/or CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. SS patients expressed heterogeneous levels of a new JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript. Patients with high-level expression of JAK3-INSL3 showed poorer 5-year survival (n = 19, 42.1%) than patients with low-level expression (n = 14, 78.6%). CTCL cells transduced with specific shRNAs or sgRNAs had decreased new JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript expression, reduced cell proliferation, and decreased colony formation. In NSG xenograft mice, smaller tumor sizes were observed in MJ cells transduced with specific shRNAs than cells transduced with controls. Our results suggest that the newly identified JAK3-INSL3 fusion transcript confers an oncogenic event in CTCL.
37834019 | Structural Analysis of Janus Tyrosine Kinase Variants in Hematological Malignancies: Implications for Drug Development and Opportunities for Novel Therapeutic Strategies. Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) variants are known drivers for hematological disorders. With the full-length structure of mouse JAK1 being recently resolved, new observations on the localization of variants within closed, open, and dimerized JAK structures are possible. Full-length homology models of human wild-type JAK family members were developed using the Glassman et al. reported mouse JAK1 containing the V658F structure as a template. Many mutational sites related to proliferative hematological disorders reside in the JH2 pseudokinase domains facing the region important in dimerization of JAKs in both closed and open states. More than half of all JAK gain of function (GoF) variants are changes in polarity, while only 1.2% are associated with a change in charge. Within a JAK1-JAK3 homodimer model, IFNLR1 (PDB ID7T6F) and the IL-2 common gamma chain subunit (IL2Rgammac) were aligned with the respective dimer implementing SWISS-MODEL coupled with ChimeraX. JAK3 variants were observed to encircle the catalytic site of the kinase domain, while mutations in the pseudokinase domain align along the JAK-JAK dimerization axis. FERM domains of JAK1 and JAK3 are identified as a hot spot for hematologic malignancies. Herein, we propose new allosteric surfaces for targeting hyperactive JAK dimers.
37845748 | A novel highly selective allosteric inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) can block inflammation- and autoimmune-related pathways. BACKGROUND: As a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, which includes JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) plays an important role in signal transduction and immune system regulation. Moreover, it is also involved in the development of many types of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). TYK2 is an attractive therapeutic target, and selective inhibition of TYK2 over other JAK family members is critical for the development of TYK2 small molecule inhibitors. However, targeting the catalytic region of the TYK2 ATP-binding site is a major challenge due to the high structural homology between the catalytic regions of the JAK family proteins. RESULTS: In this study, we developed a novel small molecule inhibitor (QL-1200186) by targeting the pseudokinase regulatory domain (Janus homology 2, JH2) of the TYK2 protein. The binding sites of QL-1200186 were predicted and screened by molecular docking. The inhibitory effects on IFNalpha, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling were tested in cell lines, human peripheral blood cells and human whole blood. The pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic properties of QL-1200186 were verified in mice. QL-1200186 showed high affinity for TYK2 JH2 and had no apparent selectivity for the TYK2 and JAK homologous kinase domains; these effects were demonstrated using biochemical binding, signaling pathway transduction (JAK1/2/3) and off-target effect assays. More importantly, we revealed that QL-1200186 was functionally comparable and selectivity superior to two clinical-stage TYK2 inhibitors (BMS-986165 and NDI-034858) in vitro. In the PK studies, QL-1200186 exhibited excellent exposure, high bioavailability and low clearance rates in mice. Oral administration of QL-1200186 dose-dependently inhibited interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) production after interleukin-12 (IL-12) challenge and significantly ameliorated skin lesions in psoriatic mice. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that QL-1200186 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of TYK2. QL-1200186 could be an appealing clinical drug candidate for the treatment of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases. Video Abstract.
38008145 | Ruxolitinib attenuates acute rejection and can serve as an immune induction therapy in heart transplantation. The benefits of IL2RA antagonists in heart transplant patients are controversial. We aimed to elucidate the effects of IL2RA antagonists and identify targets that could be better than IL2RA antagonists. By using single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells at different time points in patients receiving IL2RA antagonists, we identified nineteen types of cells. We revealed higher IL2RA expression in regulatory T cells (Tregs), suggesting that IL2RA antagonists attenuated IL-2-induced Treg activation. CD4_C04_IFNGR1 and CD8_C05_IFITM2 which had more cytotoxic effects, remained elevated at later time points. IFNGR1 was upregulated in these two subtypes, but was not expressed in Treg. Ruxolitinib targeted the pathways of IFNGR1 (JAK1/2) while not affecting the pathway of IL-2-induced Tregs activation (JAK3). Ruxolitinib showed prolonged survival compared to IL2RA mAb-treated mice. Our study provided dynamic changes of immune cells after IL2RA antagonists treatment at single-cell resolution. Ruxolitinib has potential as a new immunoinduction therapy without affecting Treg.
38031930 | Identification and Biological Evaluation of a Potent and Selective JAK1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Pulmonary Fibrosis. Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) plays a pivotal role in regulating inflammation and fibrosis via the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, making it a promising target for associated diseases. In this study, we explored the modification of an N-methyl 1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-5-carboxylate core, leading to the identification of 4-(((2S,4S)-1-(4-trifluoromethyl)-2-methylpiperidin-4-yl)amino)-N-methyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-5-carboxamide (36b) as a highly potent and selective JAK1 inhibitor. Compound 36b exhibited an impressive IC50 value of 0.044 nM for JAK1 and demonstrated remarkable selectivity of 382-fold, 210-fold, and 1325-fold specificity over JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, respectively. The kinase panel assays further confirmed its specificity, and cell-based experiments established its efficacy in inhibiting JAK1-STAT phosphorylation in human L-132 or SK-MES-1 cells. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that compound 36b boasts an oral bioavailability exceeding 36%. In a bleomycin-induced fibrosis mouse model, compound 36b significantly reduced STAT3 phosphorylation, resulting in improvement in body weight and reduced collagen deposition, all achieved without significant side effects.
38069042 | Folate-Appended Hydroxypropyl-beta-Cyclodextrin Induces Autophagic Cell Death in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cells. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogenous myeloid neoplasm that remains challenging to treat. Because intensive conventional chemotherapy reduces survival rates in elderly patients, drugs with lower toxicity and fewer side effects are needed urgently. 2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CyD) is used clinically as a pharmaceutical excipient for poorly water-soluble drugs. Previously, we showed that HP-beta-CyD exerts antitumor activity by disrupting cholesterol homeostasis. Recently, we developed folate-conjugated HP-beta-CyD (FA-HP-beta-CyD) and demonstrated its potential as a new antitumor agent that induces not only apoptosis, but also autophagic cell death; however, we do not know whether FA-HP-beta-CyD exerts these effects against AML. Here, we investigated the effects of FA-HP-beta-CyD on folate receptor (FR)-expressing AML cells. We found that the cytotoxic activity of FA-HP-beta-CyD against AML cells was stronger than that of HP-beta-CyD. Also, FA-HP-CyD induced the formation of autophagosomes in AML cell lines. FA-HP-beta-CyD increased the inhibitory effects of cytarabine and a BCL-2-selective inhibitor, Venetoclax, which are commonly used treat elderly AML patients. Notably, FA-HP-beta-CyD suppressed the proliferation of AML cells in BALB/c nude recombinase-activating gene-2 (Rag-2)/Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) double-deficient mice with AML. These results suggest that FA-HP-beta-CyD acts as a potent anticancer agent for AML chemotherapy by regulating autophagy.
38117887 | JAK3 inhibitor suppresses multipotent ILC2s and attenuates steroid-resistant asthma. Steroids are the standard treatment for allergic airway inflammation in asthma, but steroid-refractory asthma poses a challenge. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), such as T helper 2 (TH2) cells, produce key asthma-related type 2 cytokines. Recent insights from mouse and human studies indicate a potential connection between ILC2s and steroid-resistant asthma. Here, we highlight that lung ILC2s, rather than TH2 cells, can develop steroid resistance, allowing them to persist and maintain their disease-driving activity even during steroid treatment. The emergence of multipotent IL-5+IL-13+IL-17A+ ILC2s is associated with steroid-resistant ILC2s. The Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, 5, and 6 pathways contribute to the acquisition of steroid-resistant ILC2s. The JAK3 inhibitor reduces ILC2 survival, proliferation, and cytokine production in vitro and ameliorates ILC2-driven Alternaria-induced asthma. Furthermore, combining a JAK3 inhibitor with steroids results in the inhibition of steroid-resistant asthma. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for addressing this challenging condition in chronic asthma.
38254629 | High Phosphate-Induced JAK-STAT Signalling Sustains Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Inflammation and Limits Calcification. Vascular calcification (VC) is an age-related complication characterised by calcium-phosphate deposition in the arterial wall driven by the osteogenic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The JAK-STAT pathway is an emerging target in inflammation. Considering the relationship between VC and inflammation, we investigated the role of JAK-STAT signalling during VSMC calcification. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were cultured in high-inorganic phosphate (Pi) medium for up to 7 days; calcium deposition was determined via Alizarin staining and colorimetric assay. Inflammatory factor secretion was evaluated via ELISA and JAK-STAT members' activation using Western blot or immunohistochemistry on HASMCs or calcified aortas of Vitamin D-treated C57BL6/J mice, respectively. The JAK-STAT pathway was blocked by JAK Inhibitor I and Von Kossa staining was used for calcium deposits in murine aortic rings. During Pi-induced calcification, HASMCs released IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 and activated JAK1-JAK3 proteins and STAT1. Phospho-STAT1 was detected in murine calcified aortas. Blocking of the JAK-STAT cascade reduced HASMC proliferation and pro-inflammatory factor expression and release while increasing calcium deposition and osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 expression. Consistently, JAK-STAT pathway inhibition exacerbates mouse aortic ring calcification ex vivo. Intriguingly, our results suggest an alternative link between VSMC inflammation and VC.
38336380 | N-Acetylcysteine alters disease progression and increases Janus Kinase mutation frequency in a mouse model of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is the most prevalent type of cancer in young children and is associated with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was tested for its ability to alter disease progression in a mouse model of B-ALL. Mb1-CreDPB mice have deletions in genes encoding PU.1 and Spi-B in B cells and develop B-ALL at 100% incidence. Treatment of Mb1-CreDPB mice with NAC in drinking water significantly reduced the frequency of CD19+ pre-B ALL cells infiltrating the thymus at 11 weeks of age. However, treatment with NAC did not reduce leukemia progression or increase survival by median 16 weeks of age. NAC significantly altered gene expression in leukemias in treated mice. Mice treated with NAC had increased frequencies of activating mutations in genes encoding Janus Kinases 1 and 3. In particular, frequencies of Jak3 R653H mutations were increased in mice treated with NAC compared to control drinking water. NAC opposed oxidization of PTEN protein ROS in cultured leukemia cells. These results show that NAC alters leukemia progression in this mouse model, ultimately selecting for leukemias with high Jak3 R653H mutation frequencies. Significance Statement In a mouse model of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia associated with high levels of ROS, treatment with N-acetylcysteine did not delay disease progression, but instead selected for leukemic clones with increased frequency of activating R653H mutations in Janus Kinase 3.
38575346 | Computational analysis of super-resolved in situ sequencing data reveals genes modified by immune-tumor contact events. Cancer cells can manipulate immune cells and escape from the immune system response. Quantifying the molecular changes that occur when an immune cell is touching a tumor cell can increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recently, it became possible to perform such measurements in situ, for example using expansion sequencing, which enabled in situ sequencing of genes with super-resolution. We systematically examined whether individual immune cells from specific cell types express genes differently when in physical proximity to individual tumor cells. First, we demonstrated that a dense mapping of genes in situ can be utilized for the segmentation of cell bodies in 3D, thus improving our ability to detect likely touching cells. Next, we utilized three different computational approaches to detect the molecular changes that are triggered by proximity: differential expression analysis, tree-based machine learning classifiers, and matrix factorization analysis. This systematic analysis revealed tens of genes, in specific cell types, whose expression separates immune cells that are proximal to tumor cells from those that are not proximal, with a significant overlap between the different detection methods. Remarkably, an order of magnitude more genes are trigger by proximity to tumor cells in CD8 T cells compared to CD4 T cells, in line with the ability of CD8 T cells to directly bind Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I on tumor cells. Thus, in situ sequencing of an individual biopsy can be used to detect genes likely involved in immune-tumor cell-cell interactions. The data used in this manuscript and the code of the InSituSeg, Machine learning, cNMF and Moran's I methods are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/record/7845775 (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7845775).
38578092 | Indirect CD4+ T cell protection against mouse gamma-herpesvirus infection via interferon gamma. CD4+ T cells play a key role in gamma-herpesvirus infection control. However, the mechanisms involved are unclear. Murine herpesvirus type 4 (MuHV-4) allows relevant immune pathways to be dissected experimentally in mice. In the lungs, it colonizes myeloid cells, which can express MHC class II (MHCII), and type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC1), which lack it. Nevertheless, CD4+ T cells can control AEC1 infection, and this control depends on MHCII expression in myeloid cells. Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) is a major component of CD4+ T cell-dependent MuHV-4 control. Here, we show that the action of IFNgamma is also indirect, as CD4+ T cell-mediated control of AEC1 infection depended on IFNgamma receptor (IFNgammaR1) expression in CD11c+ cells. Indirect control also depended on natural killer (NK) cells. Together, the data suggest that the activation of MHCII+ CD11c+ antigen-presenting cells is key to the CD4+ T cell/NK cell protection axis. By contrast, CD8+ T cell control of AEC1 infection appeared to operate independently. IMPORTANCE: CD4+ T cells are critical for the control of gamma-herpesvirus infection; they act indirectly, by recruiting natural killer (NK) cells to attack infected target cells. Here, we report that the CD4+ T cell/NK cell axis of gamma-herpesvirus control requires interferon-gamma engagement of CD11c+ dendritic cells. This mechanism of CD4+ T cell control releases the need for the direct engagement of CD4+ T cells with virus-infected cells and may be a common strategy for host control of immune-evasive pathogens.
38583689 | The major histocompatibility complex participates in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn). The central nervous system (CNS) has previously been considered as an immune-privileged area. However, studies have shown that the immune responses are involved in PD. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presents antigens from Antigen-presenting cells(APCs) to T lymphocytes, immune responses will be induced. MHCs are expressed in microglia, astrocytes, and dopaminergic neurons. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in MHC are related to the risk of PD. The aggregated alpha-syn triggers the expression of MHCs by activating glia cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes responses and microglia activation are detected in brains of PD patients. In addiction immune responses further increase blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and T cell infiltration in PD. Thus, MHCs are involved in PD through participating in immune and inflammatory responses.
38584000 | Immunomodulation by juglone alleviates acute graft-versus-host disease without compromising the graft-versus-leukaemia activity in mice. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a major barrier to successful transplantation outcomes. Recent studies have shown that pharmacotherapy for GVHD should target both the innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses. Juglone, a redox-active phytochemical found in walnuts, has shown potent anti-inflammatory effects in models of colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. However, its effects on T-cell-mediated immune responses remain largely unknown. Considering the overlapping mediators of inflammation in GVHD and the aforementioned conditions, we investigated the use of juglone as a prophylactic agent for GVHD. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Immunomodulatory activity and mechanism of action of juglone were studied using murine splenic leukocytes in vitro. The GVHD prophylactic efficacy of orally administered juglone was evaluated using a murine model of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation based on an MHC mismatch. KEY RESULTS: Juglone exhibited immunomodulatory activity by (i) inhibiting the activation of dendritic cells and CD4+ T-cells, (ii) inhibiting cytokine secretion and lymphocyte proliferation, and (iii) inducing exhaustion of CD4+ T-cells, as shown by increased expression of CTLA-4 (CD152) and Fas (CD95). Oral administration of juglone significantly reduced mortality and morbidity associated with GVHD while maintaining graft-versus-leukaemia activity. This was accompanied by a decrease in the number of naive CD4+ cells, and an increase in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ central memory T-cells. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Juglone is a potent immunomodulator for GVHD prophylaxis. Our study is the first to provide a dosage framework for the oral administration of juglone that can be used for clinical development.
38585800 | Retinal microglia exacerbate uveitis by functioning as local antigen-presenting cells. Autoimmune uveitis is a major cause of blindness in the working-age population of developed countries. Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) depends on activation of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) specific CD4 + effector T cells that migrate systemically and infiltrate into the retina. Following systemic induction of retinal antigen-specific T cells, the development of EAU can be broken down into three phases: early phase when inflammatory cells begin to infiltrate the retina, amplification phase, and peak phase. Although studied extensively, the function of local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) within the retina remains unclear. Two potential types of APCs are present during uveitis, resident microglia and infiltrating CD11c + dendritic cells (DCs). MHC class II (MHC II) is expressed within the retina on both CD11c + DCs and microglia during the amplification phase of EAU. Therefore, we used microglia specific (P2RY12 and TMEM119) and CD11c + DC specific MHC II knockout mice to study the function of APCs within the retina using the conventional and adoptive transfer methods of inducing EAU. Microglia were essential during all phases of EAU development: the early phase when microglia were MHC Il negative, and amplification and peak phases when microglia were MHC II positive. Unexpectedly, retinal infiltrating MHC Il + CD11c + DCs were present within the retina but their antigen-presenting function was not required for all phases of uveitis. Our data indicate microglia are the critical APCs within the retina and an important therapeutic target that can prevent and/or diminish uveitis even in the presence of circulating IRBP-specific CD4 + effector T cells.
38591522 | Convergence, plasticity, and tissue residence of regulatory T cell response via TCR repertoire prism. Suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Treg) is dependent on signaling of their antigen receptors triggered by cognate self, dietary, or microbial peptides presented on MHC II. However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCRs are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we use a fixed TCRbeta chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector TCRalpha repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. This model shows highly 'digital' repertoire behavior with easy-to-track challenge-specific TCRalpha CDR3 clusters. For both eCD4 and eTreg subsets, we observe challenge-specific clonal expansions yielding homologous TCRalpha clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which are also reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some CDR3 clusters are shared across cancer challenges, suggesting a response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eTreg clonal response does not overlap. Such overlap is exclusively observed at the sites of certain tumor challenges, and not systematically, suggesting transient and local tumor-induced eCD4=>eTreg plasticity. This transition includes a dominant tumor-responding eCD4 CDR3 motif, as well as characteristic iNKT TCRalpha CDR3. In addition, we examine the homeostatic tissue residency of clonal eTreg populations by excluding the site of challenge from our analysis. We demonstrate that distinct CDR3 motifs are characteristic of eTreg cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge. This observation reveals the tissue-resident, antigen-specific clonal Treg populations.
38609101 | Dual molecule targeting HDAC6 leads to intratumoral CD4+ cytotoxic lymphocytes recruitment through MHC-II upregulation on lung cancer cells. BACKGROUND: Despite the current therapeutic treatments including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and more recently immunotherapy, the mortality rate of lung cancer stays high. Regarding lung cancer, epigenetic modifications altering cell cycle, angiogenesis and programmed cancer cell death are therapeutic targets to combine with immunotherapy to improve treatment success. In a recent study, we uncovered that a molecule called QAPHA ((E)-3-(5-((2-cyanoquinolin-4-yl)(methyl)amino)-2-methoxyphenyl)-N-hydroxyacrylamide) has a dual function as both a tubulin polymerization and HDAC inhibitors. Here, we investigate the impact of this novel dual inhibitor on the immune response to lung cancer. METHODS: To elucidate the mechanism of action of QAPHA, we conducted a chemical proteomics analysis. Using an in vivo mouse model of lung cancer (TC-1 tumor cells), we assessed the effects of QAPHA on tumor regression. Tumor infiltrating immune cells were characterized by flow cytometry. RESULTS: In this study, we first showed that QAPHA effectively inhibited histone deacetylase 6, leading to upregulation of HSP90, cytochrome C and caspases, as revealed by proteomic analysis. We confirmed that QAPHA induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) by expressing calreticulin at cell surface in vitro and demonstrated its efficacy as a vaccine in vivo. Remarkably, even at a low concentration (0.5 mg/kg), QAPHA achieved complete tumor regression in approximately 60% of mice treated intratumorally, establishing a long-lasting anticancer immune response. Additionally, QAPHA treatment promoted the infiltration of M1-polarized macrophages in treated mice, indicating the induction of a pro-inflammatory environment within the tumor. Very interestingly, our findings also revealed that QAPHA upregulated major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) expression on TC-1 tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, facilitating the recruitment of cytotoxic CD4+T cells (CD4+CTL) expressing CD4+, NKG2D+, CRTAM+, and Perforin+. Finally, we showed that tumor regression strongly correlates to MHC-II expression level on tumor cell and CD4+ CTL infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our findings shed light on the discovery of a new multitarget inhibitor able to induce ICD and MHC-II upregulation in TC-1 tumor cell. These two processes participate in enhancing a specific CD4+ cytotoxic T cell-mediated antitumor response in vivo in our model of lung cancer. This breakthrough suggests the potential of QAPHA as a promising agent for cancer treatment.
38617282 | Microglia and macrophages alterations in the CNS during acute SIV infection: a single-cell analysis in rhesus macaques. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV, as well as for the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and the establishment of a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respond in vivo to acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12-days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the population of homeostatic and preactivated microglia decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hi and CD14hiCD16low CAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Notably, specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.
38622402 | Phenotypic and Functional Characterization of Memory CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells After Antigenic Stimulation. The encounter of T cells with the antigen through the interaction of T cell receptors with peptides and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can generate effector response and memory T cells. Memory T cells developed following infections or vaccination may persist, leading to the generation of a specific immune response upon reexposure to the same pathogen through rapid clonal proliferation and activation of effector functions. T cell memory subsets can be identified based on the expression of several membrane markers such as CCR7, CD27, and CD45RA. Using fluorescent antibodies against these markers and a flow cytometer, it is possible to perform immunophenotyping via the analysis of cell surface expression of proteins by different subpopulations such as the subsets of naive, effector, and memory T cells as well as via the analysis of functional markers that further characterize each sample. Intracellular cytokine staining allows for the evaluation of intracellular proteins expressed in T cells in response to antigenic stimulation. This chapter presents the phenotypic and functional characterization of memory T cells after antigenic stimulation, detailing the procedures for identifying intracellular and surface protein markers. Herein, we review and present a reproducible standardized protocol using antibodies for specific markers and applying flow cytometry.
38625070 | Adipose-derived stem cell modulate tolerogenic dendritic cell-induced T cell regulation is correlated with activation of Notch-NFkappaB signaling. BACKGROUND: Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are recognized for their potential immunomodulatory properties. In the immune system, tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs), characterized by an immature phenotype, play a crucial role in inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) and promoting immune tolerance. Notch1 signaling has been identified as a key regulator in the development and function of DCs. However, the precise involvement of Notch1 pathway in ASC-mediated modulation of tolerogenic DCs and its impact on immune modulation remain to be fully elucidated. This study aims to investigate the interplay between ASCs and DCs, focusing the role of Notch1 signaling and downstream pathways in ASC-modulated tolerogenic DCs. METHODS: Rat bone marrow-derived myeloid DCs were directly co-cultured with ASCs to generate ASC-treated DCs (ASC-DCs). Notch signaling was inhibited using DAPT, while NFkappaB pathways were inhibited by NEMO binding domain peptide and si-NIK. Flow cytometry assessed DC phenotypes. Real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence determined the expression of Notch1, Jagged1 and the p52/RelB complex in ASC- DCs. RESULTS: Notch1 and Jagged1 were highly expressed on both DCs and ASCs. ASC-DCs displayed significantly reduced levels of CD80, CD86 and MHC II compared to mature DCs. Inhibiting the Notch pathway with DAPT reversed the dedifferentiation effects. The percentage of induced CD25+/FOXP3+/CD4+ Tregs decreased when ASC-DCs were treated with DAPT (inhibition of the Notch pathway) and si-NIK (inhibition of the non-canonical NFkappaB pathway). CONCLUSIONS: ASCs induce DC tolerogenicity by inhibiting maturation and promoting downstream Treg generation, involving the Notch and NFkappaB pathways. ASC-induced tolerogenic DCs can be a potential immunomodulatory tool for clinical application.
38629077 | Experimental trials of predicted CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes of respiratory syncytial virus. Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children around the world and an important cause of LRTI in the elderly. The available treatments and FDA-approved vaccines for RSV only lessen the severity of the infection and are recommended for infants and elderly people. Methods: We focused on developing a broad-spectrum vaccine that activates the immune system to directly combat RSV. The objective of this study is to identify CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell epitopes using an immunoinformatics approach to develop RSV vaccines. The efficacy of these peptides was validated through in-vitro and in-vivo studies involving healthy and diseased animal models. Results: For each major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I and II, we found three epitopes of RSV proteins including F, G, and SH with an antigenic score of >0.5 and a projected SVM score of <5. Experimental validation of these peptides on female BALB/c mice was conducted before and after infection with the RSV A2 line 19f. We found that the 3RVMHCI (CD8+) epitope of the F protein showed significant results of white blood cells (19.72 x 103 cells/mul), neutrophils (6.01 x 103 cells/mul), lymphocytes (12.98 x 103 cells/mul), IgG antibodies (36.9 microg/ml), IFN-gamma (86.96 ng/L), and granzyme B (691.35 pg/ml) compared to control at the second booster dose of 10 microg. Similarly, 4RVMHCII (CD4+) of the F protein substantially induced white blood cells (27.08 x 103 cells/mul), neutrophils (6.58 x 103 cells/mul), lymphocytes (16.64 x 103 cells/mul), IgG antibodies (46.13 microg/ml), IFN-gamma (96.45 ng/L), and granzyme B (675.09 pg/ml). In-vitro studies showed that 4RVMHCII produced a significant level of antibodies in sera on day 45 comparable to mice infected with the virus. 4RVMHCII also induced high IFN-gamma and IL-2 secretions on the fourth day of the challenge compared to the preinfectional stage. Conclusion: In conclusion, epitopes of the F protein showed considerable immune response and are suitable for further validation.
38637862 | Short-chain fatty acid-producing bacterial strains attenuate experimental ulcerative colitis by promoting M2 macrophage polarization via JAK/STAT3/FOXO3 axis inactivation. BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), dysbiosis, and immunosuppression who receive fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from healthy donors are at an increased risk of developing bacteremia. This study investigates the efficacy of a mixture of seven short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacterial strains (7-mix), the resulting culture supernatant mixture (mix-sup), and FMT for treating experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) and evaluates underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Utilizing culturomics, we isolated and cultured SCFA-producing bacteria from the stool of healthy donors. We used a mouse model of acute UC induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to assess the effects of 7-mix, mix-sup, and FMT on intestinal inflammation and barrier function, microbial abundance and diversity, and gut macrophage polarization by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and transwell assays. RESULTS: The abundance of several SCFA-producing bacterial taxa decreased in patients with UC. Seven-mix and mix-sup suppressed the inflammatory response and enhanced intestinal mucosal barrier function in the mouse model of UC to an extent similar to or superior to that of FMT. Moreover, 7-mix and mix-sup increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and SCFA concentrations in colitic mice. The effects of these interventions on the inflammatory response and gut barrier function were mediated by JAK/STAT3/FOXO3 axis inactivation in macrophages by inducing M2 macrophage polarization in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach provides new opportunities to rationally harness live gut probiotic strains and metabolites to reduce intestinal inflammation, restore gut microbial composition, and expedite the development of safe and effective treatments for IBD.

1106095 | Antidotal therapy and changes of acetylcholinesterase activity following isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate intoxication in mice. The antidotal action of atropine with trimedoxime, obidoxime or methoxime against isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate intoxication in mice was studied. The best antidotal effect was demonstrated for the combination of atropine and methoxime (tested as therapeutic index or D50 index). The effect of atropine (constant dose) and methoxime (different doses) on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in four parts of the mouse brain following isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate intoxication was described. The therapeutic effect could be improved by increasing dose of methoxime. AChE activity in the pontomedullar area was increased on increasing the dose of methoxime (p less than 0.005). A correlation between residual AChE activity in the pontomedullar part of the mouse brain and mortality was demonstrated.
