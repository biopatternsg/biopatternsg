37403086 | Pharmacological inhibition of demethylzeylasteral on JAK-STAT signaling ameliorates vitiligo. BACKGROUND: The activation of CD8+ T cells and their trafficking to the skin through JAK-STAT signaling play a central role in the development of vitiligo. Thus, targeting this key disease pathway with innovative drugs is an effective strategy for treating vitiligo. Natural products isolated from medicinal herbs are a useful source of novel therapeutics. Demethylzeylasteral (T-96), extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, possesses immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: The efficacy of T-96 was tested in our mouse model of vitiligo, and the numbers of CD8+ T cells infiltration and melanocytes remaining in the epidermis were quantified using whole-mount tail staining. Immune regulation of T-96 in CD8+ T cells was evaluated using flow cytometry. Pull-down assay, mass spectrum analysis, molecular docking, knockdown and overexpression approaches were utilized to identify the target proteins of T-96 in CD8+ T cells and keratinocytes. RESULTS: Here, we found that T-96 reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration in the epidermis using whole-mount tail staining and alleviated the extent of depigmentation to a comparable degree of tofacitinib (Tofa) in our vitiligo mouse model. In vitro, T-96 decreased the proliferation, CD69 membrane expression, and IFN-gamma, granzyme B, (GzmB), and perforin (PRF) levels in CD8+ T cells isolated from patients with vitiligo. Pull-down assays combined with mass spectrum analysis and molecular docking showed that T-96 interacted with JAK3 in CD8+ T cell lysates. Furthermore, T-96 reduced JAK3 and STAT5 phosphorylation following IL-2 treatment. T-96 could not further reduce IFN-gamma, GzmB and PRF expression following JAK3 knockdown or inhibit increased immune effectors expression upon JAK3 overexpression. Additionally, T-96 interacted with JAK2 in IFN-gamma-stimulated keratinocytes, inhibiting the activation of JAK2, decreasing the total and phosphorylated protein levels of STAT1, and reducing the production and secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10. T-96 did not significantly inhibit STAT1 and CXCL9/10 expression following JAK2 knockdown, nor did it suppress upregulated STAT1-CXCL9/10 signaling upon JAK2 overexpression. Finally, T-96 reduced the membrane expression of CXCR3, and the culture supernatants pretreated with T-96 under IFN-gamma stressed keratinocytes markedly blocked the migration of CXCR3+CD8+ T cells, similarly to Tofa in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that T-96 might have positive therapeutic responses to vitiligo by pharmacologically inhibiting the effector functions and skin trafficking of CD8+ T cells through JAK-STAT signaling.
37601789 | Decision trees for early prediction of inadequate immune response to coronavirus infections: a pilot study on COVID-19. Introduction: Few artificial intelligence models exist to predict severe forms of COVID-19. Most rely on post-infection laboratory data, hindering early treatment for high-risk individuals. Methods: This study developed a machine learning model to predict inherent risk of severe symptoms after contracting SARS-CoV-2. Using a Decision Tree trained on 153 Alpha variant patients, demographic, clinical and immunogenetic markers were considered. Model performance was assessed on Alpha and Delta variant datasets. Key risk factors included age, gender, absence of KIR2DS2 gene (alone or with HLA-C C1 group alleles), presence of 14-bp polymorphism in HLA-G gene, presence of KIR2DS5 gene, and presence of KIR telomeric region A/A. Results: The model achieved 83.01% accuracy for Alpha variant and 78.57% for Delta variant, with True Positive Rates of 80.82 and 77.78%, and True Negative Rates of 85.00% and 79.17%, respectively. The model showed high sensitivity in identifying individuals at risk. Discussion: The present study demonstrates the potential of AI algorithms, combined with demographic, epidemiologic, and immunogenetic data, in identifying individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 and facilitating early treatment. Further studies are required for routine clinical integration.
37850268 | HLA-DPB1*013:01 associates with enhanced, and KIR2DS4*001 with diminished protection from developing severe COVID-19. Extreme polymorphism of HLA and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) differentiates immune responses across individuals. Additional to T cell receptor interactions, subsets of HLA class I act as ligands for inhibitory and activating KIR, allowing natural killer (NK) cells to detect and kill infected cells. We investigated the impact of HLA and KIR polymorphism on the severity of COVID-19. High resolution HLA class I and II and KIR genotypes were determined from 403 non-hospitalized and 1575 hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from Italy collected in 2020. We observed that possession of the activating KIR2DS4*001 allotype is associated with severe disease, requiring hospitalization (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.85, pc  = 0.017), and this effect is greater in individuals homozygous for KIR2DS4*001 (OR = 3.74, 95% CI 1.75-9.29, pc  = 0.003). We also observed the HLA class II allotype, HLA-DPB1*13:01 protects SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from severe disease (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.74, pc  = 0.019). These association analyses were replicated using logistic regression with sex and age as covariates. Autoantibodies against IFN-alpha associated with COVID-19 severity were detected in 26% of 156 hospitalized patients tested. HLA-C*08:02 was more frequent in patients with IFN-alpha autoantibodies than those without, and KIR3DL1*01502 was only present in patients lacking IFN-alpha antibodies. These findings suggest that KIR and HLA polymorphism is integral in determining the clinical outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection, by influencing the course both of innate and adaptive immunity.
38155025 | T2-Weighted Imaging and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Histogram Parameters Predict Meningioma Consistency. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Preoperative prediction of meningioma consistency is of great clinical value for risk stratification and surgical approach selection. However, to date, objective quantitative criteria for predicting meningioma consistency have not been developed. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram parameters for meningioma consistency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, preoperative MRI, and pathological data of 103 patients with histopathologically confirmed meningiomas. Histogram parameters (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, Perc.01%, Perc.10%, Perc.50%, Perc.90%, and Perc.99%) were calculated automatically on the whole tumor using MaZda software. Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney's U test, or independent samples t-test was used to compare clinical, conventional MRI features, and histogram parameters between soft and hard meningiomas. Receiver operating characteristic curve and binary logistic regression analysis were employed to assess the predictive performance of T2WI and ADC histogram parameters. RESULTS: Tumor enhancement was the only conventional MRI feature that was statistically different between soft and hard meningiomas. ADCmean, ADCp1, ADCp10, and ADCp50 among ADC histogram parameters, and T2mean, T2p1, T2p10, T2p50, T2p90, and T2p99 among T2WI histogram parameters showed statistically significant differences between soft and hard meningiomas (all P < 0.05). We found that all combined variables (combinedall) had the best accuracy in predicting meningioma consistency, with area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of 0.873 (0.804-0.941), 88.89%, 67.50%, 80.58%, 81.20%, and 79.40%, respectively. Among them, combinedT2 is the most beneficial for predicting meningioma consistency. CONCLUSION: CombinedT2 demonstrated better predictive performance for meningioma consistency than combinedADC. T2WI and ADC histogram parameters may be imaging markers for predicting meningioma consistency.
38237587 | Human uterine natural killer cells regulate differentiation of extravillous trophoblast early in pregnancy. In humans, balanced invasion of trophoblast cells into the uterine mucosa, the decidua, is critical for successful pregnancy. Evidence suggests that this process is regulated by uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, but how they influence reproductive outcomes is unclear. Here, we used our trophoblast organoids and primary tissue samples to determine how uNK cells affect placentation. By locating potential interaction axes between trophoblast and uNK cells using single-cell transcriptomics and in vitro modeling of these interactions in organoids, we identify a uNK cell-derived cytokine signal that promotes trophoblast differentiation at the late stage of the invasive pathway. Moreover, it affects transcriptional programs involved in regulating blood flow, nutrients, and inflammatory and adaptive immune responses, as well as gene signatures associated with disorders of pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia. Our findings suggest mechanisms on how optimal immunological interactions between uNK cells and trophoblast enhance reproductive success.
38273454 | Establishing association between HLA-C*04:01 and severe COVID-19. 
38380743 | HLA peptide-binding pocket diversity modulates immunological complications after cord blood transplant in acute leukaemia. Pocket motifs and their amino acid positions of HLA molecules are known to govern antigen presentation to effector cells. Our objective was to analyse their influence on the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and relapse after umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT). The transplant characteristics of 849 patients with acute leukaemia were obtained from the Eurocord/EBMT database. Higher acute (a) GVHD was associated with homozygosity of UCB HLA-C amino acid positions 77 and 80 (NN/KK) (p = 0.008). Severe aGVHD was associated with HLA-A pocket B YSAVMENVHY motif (p = 0.002) and NN and RR genotypes of the HLA-C amino acid positions 77 and 156 (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002). Such risk was also increased in case of recipient and UCB mismatches in P4 (p < 0.0001) and P9 (p = 0.003) pockets of HLA-DQB1 alleles. For chronic GVHD, the pocket B YYAVMEISNY motif of the HLA-B*15:01 allele and the absence of mismatch between recipient and UCB in the P6 pocket of HLA-DRB1 were associated with a lower risk (p = 0.0007 and p = 0.0004). In relapse, both UCB pocket B YFAVMENVHY belonging to HLA-A*32:01 and recipient pocket B YDSVGENYQY motif of the HLA-C*07:01 allele were associated with higher risk (p = 0.0026 and p = 0.015). We provide clues on HLA-mediated cellular interactions and their role in the development of GVHD and relapse.
38400850 | Causality between COVID-19 and multiple myeloma: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study and Bayesian co-localization. Infection is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Studying the relationship between different traits of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and MM is critical for the management and treatment of MM patients with COVID-19. But all the studies on the relationship so far were observational and the results were also contradictory. Using the latest publicly available COVID-19 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of the causality between MM and different traits of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and severe COVID-19) and use multi-trait analysis of GWAS(MTAG) to identify new associated SNPs in MM. We performed co-localization analysis to reveal potential causal pathways between diseases and over-representation enrichment analysis to find involved biological pathways. IVW results showed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization increased risk of MM. In the reverse analysis, the causal relationship was not found between MM for each of the different symptoms of COVID-19. Co-localization analysis identified LZTFL1, MUC4, OAS1, HLA-C, SLC22A31, FDX2, and MAPT as genes involved in COVID-19-mediated causation of MM. These genes were mainly related to immune function, glycosylation modifications and virus defense. Three novel MM-related SNPs were found through MTAG, which may regulate the expression of B3GNT6. This is the first study to use MR to explore the causality between different traits of COVID-19 and MM. The results of our two-way MR analysis found that SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization increased the susceptibility of MM.
38401711 | Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Approaches to Identify the Synergistic Effects of Alcohol Use Disorder on the Progression of Neurological Diseases. Clinical investigations showed that individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) have worse Neurological Disease (ND) development, pointing to possible pathogenic relationships between AUD and NDs. It remains difficult to identify risk factors that are predisposing between AUD and NDs. In order to fix these issues, we created the bioinformatics pipeline and network-based approaches for employing unbiased methods to discover genes abnormally stated in both AUD and NDs and to pinpoint some of the common molecular pathways that might underlie AUD and ND interaction. We found 100 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in both the AUD and ND patient's tissue samples. The most important Gene Ontology (GO) terms and metabolic pathways, including positive control of cytotoxicity caused by T cells, proinflammatory responses, antigen processing and presentation, and platelet-triggered interactions with vascular and circulating cell pathways were then extracted using the overlapped DEGs. Protein-protein interaction analysis was used to identify hub proteins, including CCL2, IL1B, TH, MYCN, HLA-DRB1, SLC17A7, and HNF4A, in the pathways that have been reported as playing a function in these disorders. We determined several TFs (HNF4A, C4A, HLA-B, SNCA, HLA-DMB, SLC17A7, HLA-DRB1, HLA-C, HLA-A, and HLA-DPB1) and potential miRNAs (hsa-mir-34a-5p, hsa-mir-34c-5p, hsa-mir-449a, hsa-mir-155-5p, and hsa-mir-1-3p) were crucial for regulating the expression of AUD and ND which could serve as prospective targets for treatment. Our methodologies discovered unique putative biomarkers that point to the interaction between AUD and various neurological disorders, as well as pathways that could one day be the focus of therapeutic intervention.
38424564 | Contribution of HLA class I (A, B, C) and HLA class II (DRB1, DQA1, DQB1) alleles and haplotypes in exploring ethnic origin of central Tunisians. BACKGROUND: Estimation of HLA (Human leukocyte Antigen) alleles' frequencies in populations is essential to explore their ethnic origin. Anthropologic studies of central Tunisian population were rarely reported. Then, in this work, we aimed to explore the origin of central Tunisian population using HLA alleles and haplotypes frequencies. METHODS: HLA class I (A, B, C) and HLA class II (DRB1, DQA1, DQB1) loci genotyping of 272 healthy unrelated organ donors was performed by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Sequence Specific Oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO). We compared central Tunisians with other populations (Arabs, Berbers, Mediterraneans, Europeans, Africans, etc.) using alleles and haplotypes frequencies, genetic distances, Neighbour-Joining dendrogram and correspondence analysis. RESULTS: Among the 19 HLA A alleles, the 26 HLA B alleles, the 13 HLA C alleles, the 15 HLA DRB1 alleles, the 6 HLA DQA1 alleles and the 5 HLA DQB1 alleles identified in the studied population, HLA A*02 (22.8%), HLA B*50 (13.1%), HLA C*06 (21.8%), HLA DRB1*07 (17.8%), HLA DQA1*01 (32.1%) and HLA DQB1*03 (31.6%) were the most frequent alleles. The extended haplotypes HLA A*02-B*50-C*06-DRB1*07-DQA1*02-DQB1*02 (1.97%) was the most frequent HLA six-loci haplotype. CONCLUSION: Central Tunisians were very close to other Tunisian populations, to Iberians and North Africans. They were rather distant from sub-Saharan populations and eastern Mediterraneans especially Arabs although the strong cultural and religious impact of Arabs in this population.
38459565 | Frequency distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in Greek population and their significance in orchestrating the National Donor Registry Program. Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) represent one of the most polymorphic systems in humans, responsible for the identification of foreign antigens and the presentation of immune responses. Therefore, HLA is considered to play a major role in human disorders, donor-recipient matching and transplantation outcomes. This study aimed to determine the HLA class I and II alleles and haplotypes in the Greek population. Moreover, a comparative analysis of HLA alleles and haplotype frequencies found in Greek and pooled European populations was also performed to acquire a better knowledge about the HLA alleles distribution. A total number of 1896 healthy individuals were typed for their HLA alleles in the National Tissue Typing Center of Greece. High-resolution HLA typing for the HLA-A, -B, -C and -DR, -DQ, -DP with the use of the next-generation sequencing analysis was performed, followed by data analysis for establishing the HLA allele and haplotype differences. The results of this study showed that the most frequent alleles for the HLA-A were the A*02:01:01 (27.1%), *24:02:01 (14.4%), *01:01:01 (9.3%), for the HLA-B were the B*51:01:01 (15.3%), *18:01:01 (9.7%), *35:01:01 (6.8%) and for the HLA-C were the C*04:01:01 (15.4%), *07:01:01 (13.1%), *12:03:01 (9.6%). For the HLA class II, the most frequent alleles for the HLA-DRB1 were the DRB1*11:04:01 (16.4%), *16:01:01 (11.3%), *11:01:01 (9.5%), for the HLA-DQB1 were the DQB1*03:01:01 (30.5%), *05:02:01 (15.1%), *05:01:01 (10.6%) and for the HLA-DPB1 were the DPB1*04:01:01 (34.8%), *02:01:01 (11.6%), *04:02:01 (7.3%). Additionally, the most frequent haplotypes were the A*02:01:01~C*07:01:01-B*18:01:01~DRB1*11:04:01 (2.3%), followed by the A*01:01:01~C*07:01:01~B*08:01:01~DRB1*03:01:01 (2.2%), A*24:02:01~C*04:01:01~B*35:02:01~DRB1*11:04:01 (1.4%) and A*02:01:01~C*04:01:01~B*35:01:01-DRB1*14:01:01 (1.2%). The results herein were comparable to those obtained from the pooled European populations. Moreover, these results can be used for the improvement of the donor-recipient matching procedure and to understand better the disease association in Greece.
38462359 | [Establishment and validation of prediction models for human leukocyte antigen haplotypes and human leukocyte antigen genotypes]. Objective: To establish prediction models for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes and HLA genotypes, and verify the prediction accuracy. Methods: The prediction models were established based on the characteristic of HLA haplotype inheritance and linkage disequilibrium (LD), as well as the invention patents and software copyrights obtained. The models include algorithm and reference databases such as HLA A-C-B-DRB1-DQB1 high-resolution haplotypes database, B-C and DRB1-DQB1 LD database, G group alleles table, and NMDP Code alleles table. The prediction algorithm involves data processing, comparison with reference data, filtering results, probability calculation and ranking, confidence degree estimation, and output of prediction results. The accuracy of the predictions was verified by comparing them with the correct results, and the relationship between prediction accuracy and the probability distribution and confidence degree of the predicted results was analyzed. Results: The HLA haplotypes and genotypes prediction models were established. The prediction algorithm included the prediction of A-C-B-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes according to HLA-A, B, DRB1, C, DQB1 genotypes, the prediction of C and DQB1 high-resolution results according to A, B and DRB1 high-resolution results, and the prediction of A, B, DRB1, C and DQB1 high resolution results according to the A, B and DRB1 intermediate or low resolution results. Validation results of \Predicting A-C-B-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes basing on HLA-A, B, DRB1, C, DQB1 genotypes\ model: for 787 data, the accuracy was 94.0% (740/787) with 740 correct predictions, 34 incorrect predictions, and 13 instances with no predicted results. For 847 data, the accuracy was 100% (847/847). The 2 411 and 2 594 haplotype combinations predicted from 787 and 847 data were grouped according to confidence degree, the accuracy was 100% (48/48, 114/114) for a confidence degree of 1, 96.2% (303/315) and 97.8% (409/418) for a confidence degree of 2 respectively. Validation results of \Predicting A, B, DRB1 and C, DQB1 high-resolution genotypes basing on HLA-A, B, DRB1 high, intermediate, or low resolution genotypes\ model: when predicting C and DQB1 high resolution genotypes basing on A, B, and DRB1 high resolution genotypes, 89.3% (1 459/1 634) of the predictions were correct. The accuracy for the top 2 predicted probability (GPP) ranking was 79.2% (1 156/1 459), and for the top 10, it was 95.0% (1 386/1 459). Furthermore, when GPP>=90% and GPP 50%-90%, the prediction accuracy was 81.3% (209/257) and 72.8% (447/614) respectively. The accuracy of predicting C and DQB1 high resolution genotypes basing on the results of A, B, and DRB1 high resolution genotypes from the China Marrow Donor Program was 87.0% (20/23). The accuracy of predicting A, B, DRB1, C, and DQB1 high resolution genotypes basing on the results of A, B, and DRB1 intermediate or low-resolution genotypes was 70.0% (7/10) and 52.5% (21/40) respectively. When predicting whether the patient is likely to have a HLA 10/10 matched donor, the accuracy of the top 2 GPP combinations with a proportion of >=50% was 85.7% (6/7). Conclusions: When using A, B, DRB1, C, DQB1 genotypes to predict A-C-B-DRB1-DQB1 haplotype combinations, the results with a confidence degree of 1 and 2 are reliable. When predicting C and DQB1 genotypes according to A, B and DRB1 genotypes, the top 10 results ranked by GPP are reliable, and the top 2 results with GPP>=50% are more reliable.
38469033 | Genetic risk for hospitalization of African American patients with severe mental illness reveals HLA loci. Background: Mood disorders such as major depressive and bipolar disorders, along with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and other psychotic disorders, constitute serious mental illnesses (SMI) and often lead to inpatient psychiatric care for adults. Risk factors associated with increased hospitalization rate in SMI (H-SMI) are largely unknown but likely involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and socio-behavioral factors. We performed a genome-wide association study in an African American cohort to identify possible genes associated with hospitalization due to SMI (H-SMI). Methods: Patients hospitalized for psychiatric disorders (H-SMI; n=690) were compared with demographically matched controls (n=4467). Quality control and imputation of genome-wide data were performed following the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC)-PTSD guidelines. Imputation of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) locus was performed using the HIBAG package. Results: Genome-wide association analysis revealed a genome-wide significant association at 6p22.1 locus in the ubiquitin D (UBD/FAT10) gene (rs362514, p=9.43x10-9) and around the HLA locus. Heritability of H-SMI (14.6%) was comparable to other psychiatric disorders (4% to 45%). We observed a nominally significant association with 2 HLA alleles: HLA-A*23:01 (OR=1.04, p=2.3x10-3) and HLA-C*06:02 (OR=1.04, p=1.5x10-3). Two other genes (VSP13D and TSPAN9), possibly associated with immune response, were found to be associated with H-SMI using gene-based analyses. Conclusion: We observed a strong association between H-SMI and a locus that has been consistently and strongly associated with SCZ in multiple studies (6p21.32-p22.1), possibly indicating an involvement of the immune system and the immune response in the development of severe transdiagnostic SMI.
38478091 | HLA class I NK-epitopes and KIR diversities in patients with multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy caused by the clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Myeloma cells are susceptible to killing by natural killer (NK) cells, but NK cells fail to control disease progression, suggesting immunosuppression. The activation threshold of NK-effector function is regulated by interaction between KIRs and self-HLA class I, during a process called \education\ to ensure self-tolerance. NK cells can respond to diseased cells based on the absence of HLA class I expression (\Missing-self\ hypothesis). The HLA and KIR repertoire is extremely diverse; thus, the present study aimed to characterize potential variances in genotypic composition of HLA Class I NK-epitopes and KIRs between MM patients and healthy controls. Genotypic expression of KIR and HLA (HLA-C group-C1/C2 and Bw4 motifs (including HLA-A*23, A*24, A*32) were analyzed in 172 MM patients and 195 healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, we did not observe specific KIR genes or genotypes, or HLA NK-epitopes with higher prevalence among MM patients. The presence of all three HLA NK-epitopes (C1+C2+Bw4+) was not associated with MM occurrence. However, MM patients were more likely to be C1-/C2+/Bw4+ (p = 0.049, OR 1.996). In line with this, there was a trend of increased genetic co-occurrence of Bw4 and KIR3DL1 in MM patients (p = 0.05, OR 1.557). Furthermore, MM patients were more likely to genetically express both C2/KIR2DL1 and Bw4/KIR3DL1 (p = 0.019, OR 2.453). Our results reveal an HLA NK-epitope combination that is associated with the occurrence of MM. No specific KIR genotypes were associated with MM.
38485627 | [Update for cord blood unit selection in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (workshop SFGM-TC)]. Changing practices and the limited use of cord blood units as a source of cells for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSC) led us to reconsider the recommendations established in 2011 and 2012, and to propose an update incorporating recent bibliographic data. If HLA compatibility was until now established at low resolution for HLA-A and B loci, and at high resolution for HLA-DRB1, the recent papers are converging towards an increase in the level of resolution, making way for a compatibility now defined in high resolution for all the considered loci, and the inclusion of the HLA-C locus, in order to establish a level of HLA compatibility on 8 alleles (HLA-A, B, C and DRB1). The CD34+ dose is a determining factor in hematopoietic reconstitution but it is not correlated with the total nucleated cells content. This is why we recommend taking these two data into account when choosing a cord blood unit. The recommendations established by our group are presented as a flow chart taking into account the characteristics of the underlying pathology (malignant or non-malignant), the cell dose and the HLA compatibility criteria, as well as criteria linked to the banks in which units are stored.
38643729 | Multi-omics study reveals different pathogenesis of the generation of skin lesions in SLE and IDLE patients. Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a heterogeneous, antibody-mediated autoimmune disease. Isolate discoid LE (IDLE) and systematic LE (SLE) are traditionally regarded as the two ends of the spectrum, ranging from skin-limited damage to life-threatening multi-organ involvement. Both belong to LE, but IDLE and SLE differ in appearance of skin lesions, autoantibody panels, pathological changes, treatments, and immunopathogenesis. Is discoid lupus truly a form of LE or is it a completely separate entity? This question has not been fully elucidated. We compared the clinical data of IDLE and SLE from our center, applied multi-omics technology, such as immune repertoire sequencing, high-resolution HLA alleles sequencing and multi-spectrum pathological system to explore cellular and molecular phenotypes in skin and peripheral blood from LE patients. Based on the data from 136 LE patients from 8 hospitals in China, we observed higher damage scores and fewer LE specific autoantibodies in IDLE than SLE patients, more uCDR3 sharing between PBMCs and skin lesion from SLE than IDLE patients, elevated diversity of V-J recombination in IDLE skin lesion and SLE PBMCs, increased SHM frequency and class switch ratio in IDLE skin lesion, decreased SHM frequency but increased class switch ratio in SLE PBMCs, HLA-DRB1*03:01:01:01, HLA-B*58:01:01:01, HLA-C*03:02:02:01, and HLA-DQB1*02:01:01:01 positively associated with SLE patients, and expanded Tfh-like cells with ectopic germinal center structures in IDLE skin lesions. These findings suggest a significant difference in the immunopathogenesis of skin lesions between SLE and IDLE patients. SLE is a B cell-predominate systemic immune disorder, while IDLE appears limited to the skin. Our findings provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of IDLE and other types of LE, which may direct more accurate diagnosis and novel therapeutic strategies.
15147562 | Impaired chemokine-induced migration during T-cell development in the absence of Jak 3. The arrival of bone marrow T-cell progenitors to the thymus, and the directed migration of thymocytes, are thought to be regulated by the expression of chemokines and their receptors. Recent data has shown that the Jak/Stat signalling pathway is involved in chemokine receptor signalling. We have investigated the role of Jak 3 in chemokine-mediated signalling in the thymus using Jak 3(-/-) mice. These mice show defects in T-cell development, as well as in peripheral T-cell function, resulting in a hypoplastic thymus and an altered T-cell homeostasis. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that bone marrow progenitors and thymocytes from Jak 3(-/-) mice have decreased chemotactic responses to CXCL12 and CCL25. We also show that Jak 3 is involved in signalling through CCR9 and CXCR4, and that specific inhibition of Jak 3 in wild-type progenitors and thymocytes decreases their chemotactic responses towards CCL25 and CXCL12. Finally, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that thymocytes from Jak 3(-/-) mice express similar levels of CXCR4 and CCR9 compared to wild-type mice. Altogether, deficient CCL25- and CXCL12-induced migration could result in a homing defect of T-cell progenitors to the thymus, as well as in a deficient thymocyte migration through the thymic stroma. Our results strongly suggest that the absence of Jak 3 affects T-cell development, not only through an impaired interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R)-mediated signalling, but also through impaired chemokine-mediated responses, which are crucial for thymocyte migration and differentiation.
15548928 | Inherited disorders of cytokines. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cytokines are soluble mediators involved in the development or function of the immune system. This paper reviews the literature on childhood-onset inherited disorders associated with impaired cytokine-mediated immunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Cytokine-mediated immunity defects can be classified into seven different groups: defects in the interleukin (IL)-7 receptor (IL7RA), in the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac) of the IL-2, -4, -7, -15, and -21, and in Jak3 (JAK3) downstream of the gamma chain; mutation in the IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2RA) and defective expression of the IL-2Rbeta chain; mutations in the gene encoding for a chemokine receptor, CXCR4; mutations in five genes involved in the IL-12/23-interferon-gamma axis (IL12B, IL12RB1, IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1); mutations in three genes involved in the nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway (IRAK4, NEMO, IkappaBA); mutations in the tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway (TNFRSF1A); and mutations in the transforming growth factor-1 gene (TGFB1). SUMMARY: Genetic cytokine-mediated immunity defects are associated with a highly heterogeneous group of clinical features, ranging from susceptibility to infections to developmental defects. This heterogeneity highlights the diversity and pleiotropy of cytokines. It is likely that many more cytokine defects and their responsive pathways will be discovered in the coming years, expanding further the heterogeneity associated with this group of childhood-onset illnesses.
15611059 | CXCL12 signaling is independent of Jak2 and Jak3. Janus kinases (Jaks) are a small family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, critical for signaling by Type I and II cytokine receptors. The importance of Jaks in signaling by these receptors has been firmly established by analysis of mutant cell lines, the generation of Jak knock-out mice, and the identification of patients with Jak3 mutations. While a number of other ligands that do not bind Type I and II cytokine receptors have also been reported to activate Jaks, the requirement for Jaks in signaling by these receptors is less clear. Chemokines for example, which bind seven transmembrane receptors, have been reported to activate Jaks, and principally through the use of pharmacological inhibitors, it has been argued that Jaks are essential for chemokine signaling. In the present study, we focused on CXCR4, which binds the chemokine CXCL12 or stromal cell-derived factor-1, a chemokine that has been reported to activate Jak2 and Jak3. We found that the lack of Jak3 had no effect on CXCL12 signaling or chemotaxis nor did overexpression of wild-type versions of the kinase. Similarly, overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive Jak2 or \knocking-down\ Jak2 expression using siRNA also had no effect. We also found that in primary lymphocytes, CXCL12 did not induce appreciable phosphorylation of any of the Jaks compared with cytokines for which these kinases are required. Additionally, little or no Stat (signal transducer and activator of transcription) phosphorylation was detected. Thus, we conclude that in contrast to previous reports, Jaks, especially Jak3, are unlikely to play an essential role in chemokine signaling.
17521370 | Janus kinase 3-deficient T lymphocytes have an intrinsic defect in CCR7-mediated homing to peripheral lymphoid organs. Chemokine-mediated signalling involves the activation of a Janus kinase (Jak) pathway. We have previously shown that Jak3 mediates CCR9 and CXCR4 signalling in response to CCL25 and CXCL12 in BM progenitors and thymocytes. The lack of peripheral lymph nodes and Peyer's patches observed in Jak3(-/-) mice suggested a possible role of Jak3 in CCR7-mediated homing to these organs. Here, we demonstrate phosphorylation of Jak3 in peripheral lymphocytes in response CCL19 and CCL21. In addition, Jak3(-/-) naive T cells and pharmacologically inhibited Jak3(+/+) T lymphocytes have impaired chemotactic responses towards these ligands. Interestingly, CCR7 expression was higher in Jak3(-/-) thymocytes compared to their Jak3(+)(/-) littermates, indicating that the impaired migration must be caused by impaired CCR7-mediated signalling, in the absence of Jak3. In addition, adoptive transfer experiments showed that Jak3(+/+) mice reconstituted with Jak3(-/-) green fluorescent protein (GFP)(+) bone marrow progenitors had reduced T-lymphocyte homing to peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, compared to reconstitution with Jak3(+/+) GFP(+) progenitors. Furthermore, reciprocal transfer experiments indicated that Jak3(-/-) stromal cells were not responsible for the deficient T-cell homing. Finally, we performed direct competitive homing assays and demonstrated that Jak3(-/-) T lymphocytes have a clear defect in homing to peripheral and mesenteric lymph nodes, while migration to spleen was moderately impaired. Our data demonstrates that Jak3(-/-) T lymphocytes have an intrinsic defect in CCR7-mediated homing to peripheral lymphoid organs.
24498424 | Jak3 enables chemokine-dependent actin cytoskeleton reorganization by regulating cofilin and Rac/Rhoa GTPases activation. We have previously shown that Jak3 is involved in the signaling pathways of CCR7, CCR9 and CXCR4 in murine T lymphocytes and that Jak3-/- lymphocytes display an intrinsic defect in homing to peripheral lymph nodes. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the defective migration observed in Jak3-/- lymphocytes remains elusive. Here, it is demonstrated for the first time, that Jak3 is required for the actin cytoskeleton reorganization in T lymphocytes responding to chemokines. It was found that Jak3 regulates actin polymerization by controlling cofilin inactivation in response to CCL21 and CXCL12. Interestingly, cofilin inactivation was not precluded in PTX- treated cells despite their impaired actin polymerization. Additionally, Jak3 was required for small GTPases Rac1 and RhoA activation, which are indispensable for acquisition of the migratory cell phenotype and the generation of a functional leading edge and uropod, respectively. This defect correlates with data obtained by time-lapse video-microscopy showing an incompetent uropod formation and impaired motility in Jak3-pharmacologically inhibited T lymphocytes. Our data support a new model in which Jak3 and heterotrimeric G proteins can use independent, but complementary, signaling pathways to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics during cell migration in response to chemokines.
24587342 | FRA2 is a STAT5 target gene regulated by IL-2 in human CD4 T cells. Signal transducers and activators of transcription 5(STAT5) are cytokine induced signaling proteins, which regulate key immunological processes, such as tolerance induction, maintenance of homeostasis, and CD4 T-effector cell differentiation. In this study, transcriptional targets of STAT5 in CD4 T cells were studied by Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Genomic mapping of the sites cloned and identified in this study revealed the striking observation that the majority of STAT5-binding sites mapped to intergenic (>50 kb upstream) or intronic, rather than promoter proximal regions. Of the 105 STAT5 responsive binding sites identified, 94% contained the canonical (IFN-gamma activation site) GAS motifs. A number of putative target genes identified here are associated with tumor biology. Here, we identified Fos-related antigen 2 (FRA2) as a transcriptional target of IL-2 regulated STAT5. FRA2 is a basic -leucine zipper (bZIP) motif 'Fos' family transcription factor that is part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex and is also known to play a critical role in the progression of human tumours and more recently as a determinant of T cell plasticity. The binding site mapped to an internal intron within the FRA2 gene. The epigenetic architecture of FRA2, characterizes a transcriptionally active promoter as indicated by enrichment for histone methylation marks H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and transcription/elongation associated marks H2BK5me1 and H4K20me1. FRA2 is regulated by IL-2 in activated CD4 T cells. Consistently, STAT5 bound to GAS sequence in the internal intron of FRA2 and reporter gene assays confirmed IL-2 induced STAT5 binding and transcriptional activation. Furthermore, addition of JAK3 inhibitor (R333) or Daclizumab inhibited the induction in TCR stimulated cells. Taken together, our data suggest that FRA2 is a novel STAT5 target gene, regulated by IL-2 in activated CD4 T cells. 
24607275 | Inhibition of STAT3 activation by KT-18618 via the disruption of the interaction between JAK3 and STAT3. The constitutive activation of STAT3 in human cancers causes the abnormal proliferation and survival of cancer cells, and thus, STAT3 is a therapeutic target of antitumor drugs. We screened a small-molecule library of 8600 synthetic compounds from the \Korea Chemical Bank\ to identify inhibit STAT3 activity using a cell-based luciferase assay system. KT-18618 ((Z)-N-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-2-[1,3,3,3,-tetrafluoro-2-(thiophen-2-yl)prop-1-enyloxy]-acetamide) was selected as a novel inhibitor of the JAK/STAT3 pathway. KT-18618 inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation and the expression of STAT3-regulated genes. The inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation led to the apoptosis of MDA-MB-468 cells. We postulated that the inhibition of the JAK family of proteins or c-Src inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of these kinases was only mildly inhibited, but the phosphorylation of STAT3 was completely inhibited. This result implies that the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by KT-18618 is an independent event that occurs through the phosphorylation of upstream kinases. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that KT-18618 inhibited the JAK3-STAT3 interaction. Moreover, JAK3 molecules were captured by biotinylated KT-18618, implying that KT-18618 bound to JAK3 molecules. Additionally, 1muM KT-18618 inhibited JAK3 kinase activity by approximately 28% in an in vitro kinase assay. From these results, we suggest that KT-18618 binds to JAK3 molecules and disrupts the JAK3-STAT3 interaction, which leads to the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. KT-18618 is the first inhibitor of the JAK3-STAT3 interaction. 
26279433 | Impact of Janus Kinase 3 on Cellular Ca Release, Store Operated Ca(2+) Entry and Na(+)/Ca(2+) Exchanger Activity in Dendritic Cells. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), a tyrosine kinase mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, participates in the signaling stimulating cell proliferation. The kinase is expressed in dendritic cells (DCs), antigen presenting cells involved in the initiation and regulation of antigen-specific T-cell responses. Dendritic cell function is regulated by cytosolic Ca(2+) activity ([Ca(2+)]i). Mediators increasing [Ca(2+)]i in DCs include ATP and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 ligand CXCL12. The present study explored, whether JAK3 participates in the regulation of [Ca(2+)]i in DCs. METHODS: Fura-2 fluorescence was employed to determine [Ca(2+)]i, and whole cell patch clamp to decipher electrogenic transport in immature DCs isolated from bone marrow of JAK3-knockout (jak3(-/-)) or wild-type mice (jak3(+/+)). RESULTS: Without treatment, [Ca(2+)]i was similar in jak3(-/-) and jak3(+/+) DCs. Addition of ATP (100 microM) was followed by transient increase of [Ca(2+)]i reflecting Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, an effect significantly less pronounced in jak3(-/-) DCs than in jak3(+/+) DCs. CXCL12 administration was followed by a sustained increase of [Ca(2+)]i reflecting receptor operated Ca(2+) entry, an effect significantly less rapid in jak3(-/-) DCs than in jak3(+/+) DCs. In addition, the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channel (CRAC) current triggered by IP3-induced Ca(2+) store depletion and CXCL12 was significantly higher in DCs from jak3(+/+) mice than in jak3(-/-) mice. Inhibition of sarcoendoplasmatic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) by thapsigargin (1 microM) in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) was followed by a transient increase of [Ca(2+)]i reflecting Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores, and subsequent readdition of extracellular Ca(2+) in the continued presence of thapsigargin was followed by a sustained increase of [Ca(2+)]i reflecting store operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Both, Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores and SOCE were again significantly lower in jak3(-/-) DCs than in jak3(+/+) DCs. Pretreatment of jak3(+/+) DCs with JAK inhibitor WHI-P154 (22 microM, 10 minutes or 24 hours) significantly blunted both thapsigargin induced Ca(2+) release and subsequent SOCE. Abrupt replacement of Na(+) containing (130 mM) and Ca(2+) free (0 mM) extracellular bath by Na(+) free (0 mM) and Ca(2+) containing (2 mM) extracellular bath increased [Ca(2+)]i reflecting Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger activity, an effect again significantly less pronounced in jak3(-/-) DCs than in jak3(+/+) DCs. CONCLUSIONS: JAK3 deficiency is followed by down-regulation of cytosolic Ca(2+) release, receptor and store operated Ca(2+) entry and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger activity in DCs.
27002119 | IL-4 enhances expression and function of surface IgM in CLL cells. Kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) are now prominent in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have focused here on interleukin 4 (IL-4), a cytokine that protects normal and malignant B cells from apoptosis and increases surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) expression on murine splenic B cells. First, we have demonstrated that IL-4 treatment increased sIgM expression in vitro on peripheral blood B cells obtained from healthy individuals. In CLL, IL-4 target genes are overexpressed in cells purified from the lymph nodes of patients compared with cells derived from matched blood and bone marrow samples. As for normal B cells, IL-4 increased sIgM expression on CLL cells in vitro, especially in samples expressing unmutated V-genes. IL-4-induced sIgM expression was associated with increased receptor signalling activity, measured by anti-IgM-induced calcium mobilization, and with increased expression of CD79B messenger RNA and protein, and the \mature\ glycoform of sIgM. Importantly, the ability of the BCR-associated kinase inhibitors idelalisib and ibrutinib, approved for treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies, to inhibit anti-IgM-induced signalling was reduced following IL-4 pretreatment in samples from the majority of patients. In contrast to stimulatory effects on sIgM, IL-4 decreased CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression; therefore, CLL cells, particularly within the progressive unmutated V-gene subset, may harness the ability of IL-4 to promote BCR signalling and B-cell retention within lymph nodes. Effects of IL-4 were mediated via JAK3/STAT6 and we propose a potential role for JAK inhibitors in combination with BCR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CLL.
31985363 | Regulation of Immunity-Related Genes by Infectious Bronchitis Virus Challenge in Spleen of Laying Chickens. Understanding of host pathogen interactions is important in planning strategies for effective control of the pathogen. The present study investigated the regulation of genes involved in the activation of splenic immune system in mature laying chickens challenged with T strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Among all the genes studied, the relative expression levels of Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS), interleukin 7 (IL7), IL18, proteasome subunit alpha 3 (PSMA3), major histocompatibility complex, class II (MHCII), interferon alpha (IFNalpha), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) were significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated, while Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR5 were significantly downregulated in the challenge compared with the control group. Genes such as vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), FK506-binding protein 1B (FKBP1B), transforming growth factor-beta 3 (TGFB3), NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), TYRO3 protein tyrosine kinase (TYRO3), TNF receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), macrophage inflammatory protein-3 (MIP3A), TLR2-1, TLR3, and TLR21 were not altered in mRNA expression levels between the challenge and control groups. In conclusion, the splenic immune response to IBV infection involved the regulation of cytokines, TLRs and NF-kappaB.
35040417 | Ligand-based Modeling of CXC Chemokine Receptor 4 and Identification of Inhibitors of Novel Chemotypes as Potential Leads towards New Anti- COVID-19 Treatments. BACKGROUND: Chemokines are involved in several human diseases and different stages of COVID-19 infection. They play a critical role in the pathophysiology of the associated acute respiratory disease syndrome, a major complication leading to death among COVID-19 patients. In particular, CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was found to be highly expressed in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We herein describe a computational workflow based on combining pharmacophore modeling and QSAR analysis towards the discovery of novel CXCR4 inhibitors. Subsequent virtual screening identified two promising CXCR4 inhibitors from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) list of compounds. The most active hit showed in vitro IC50 value of 24.4 muM. CONCLUSION: These results proved the validity of the QSAR model and associated pharmacophore models as means to screen virtual databases for new CXCR4 inhibitors as leads for the development of new COVID-19 therapies.
35866483 | PTP1B inhibitors protect against acute lung injury and regulate CXCR4 signaling in neutrophils. Acute lung injury (ALI) can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a lethal condition with limited treatment options and currently a common global cause of death due to COVID-19. ARDS secondary to transfusion-related ALI (TRALI) has been recapitulated preclinically by anti-MHC-I antibody administration to LPS-primed mice. In this model, we demonstrate that inhibitors of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates signaling pathways of fundamental importance to homeostasis and inflammation, prevented lung injury and increased survival. Treatment with PTP1B inhibitors attenuated the aberrant neutrophil function that drives ALI and was associated with release of myeloperoxidase, suppression of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and inhibition of neutrophil migration. Mechanistically, reduced signaling through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, particularly to the activation of PI3Kgamma/AKT/mTOR, was essential for these effects, linking PTP1B inhibition to promoting an aged-neutrophil phenotype. Considering that dysregulated activation of neutrophils has been implicated in sepsis and causes collateral tissue damage, we demonstrate that PTP1B inhibitors improved survival and ameliorated lung injury in an LPS-induced sepsis model and improved survival in the cecal ligation and puncture-induced (CLP-induced) sepsis model. Our data highlight the potential for PTP1B inhibition to prevent ALI and ARDS from multiple etiologies.
36160003 | Inflammation and immunity connect hypertension with adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Objectives: To explore the connection of hypertension and severe COVID-19 outcomes. Methods: A total of 68 observational studies recording mortality and/or general severity of COVID-19 were pooled for meta-analyses of the relationship of severe COVID-19 outcomes with hypertension as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Genome-wide cross-trait meta-analysis (GWCTM) was performed to explore the genes linking between hypertension and COVID-19 severity. Results: The results of meta-analysis with the random effect model indicated that pooled risk ratios of hypertension on mortality and severity of COVID-19 were 1.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-2.1] and 1.78 (95% confidence interval 1.56-2.04), respectively, although the apparent heterogeneity of the included studies was detected. In subgroup analysis, cohorts of severe and mild patients of COVID-19 assessed in Europe had a significant pooled weighted mean difference of 6.61 mmHg (95% CI 3.66-9.55) with no heterogeneity found (p = 0.26). The genes in the shared signature of hypertension and the COVID-19 severity were mostly expressed in lungs. Analysis of molecular networks commonly affected both by hypertension and by severe COVID-19 highlighted CCR1/CCR5 and IL10RB signaling, as well as Th1 and Th2 activation pathways, and also a potential for a shared regulation with multiple sclerosis. Conclusion: Hypertension is significantly associated with the severe course of COVID-19. Genetic variants within inflammation- and immunity-related genes may affect their expression in lungs and confer liability to both elevated blood pressure and to severe COVID-19.
36232231 | COVID-19 Vaccination and Mental Stress within Diverse Sociodemographic Groups. In this study, we surveyed 635 participants to determine: (a) major causes of mental stress during the pandemic and its future impacts, and (b) diversity in public perception of the COVID-19 vaccination and its acceptance (specifically for children). Statistical results and intelligent clustering outcomes indicate significant associations between sociodemographic diversity, mental stress causes, and vaccination perception. For instance, statistical results indicate significant dependence between gender (we will use term 'sex' in the rest of the manuscript) and mental stress due to COVID-19 infection (p = 1.7 x 10-5). Over 25% of males indicated work-related stress compared to 35% in females, however, females indicated that they were more stressed (17%) due to relationships compared to males (12%). Around 30% of Asian/Arabic participants do not feel that the vaccination is safe as compared to 8% of white British and 22% of white Europeans, indicating significant dependence (p = 1.8 x 10-8) with ethnicity. More specifically, vaccination acceptance for children is significantly dependent with ethnicity (p = 3.7 x 10-5) where only 47% participants show willingness towards children's vaccination. The primary dataset in this study along with experimental outcomes identifying sociodemographic information diversity with respect to public perception and acceptance of vaccination in children and potential stress factors might be useful for the public and policymakers to help them be better prepared for future epidemics, as well as working globally to combat mental health issues.
36257839 | Influence of meteorological factors on the severity of COVID-19 in Spain: Observational ecological study. OBJECTIVES: Evaluating whether meteorological and geographical variables could be associated with the severity of COVID-19 in Spain. METHODS: An ecological study was performed to analyze the influence of meteorological and geographical factors in hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19 in the 52 provinces of Spain (24 coastal and 28 inland regions), during the first three pandemic waves. Medical and mortality data were collected from the CarlosIII Health Institute (ISCIII) and meteorological variables were requested to the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). RESULTS: Regarding the diagnosed cases it is remarkable that the percentage of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was lower in the coastal provinces than in the inland ones (8.7+-2.6% vs. 11.5+-2.6%; P=9.9x10-5). Furthermore, coastal regions registered a lower percentage of mortality than inland regions (2.0+-0.6% vs. 3.1+-0.8%; P=1.7x10-5). Mean air temperature was inversely correlated both with COVID-19 hospitalizations (Rho: -0.59; P=3.0x10-6) and mortality (Rho: -0.70; P=5.3x10-9). In those provinces with a mean air temperature <10 C mortality by COVID-19 was twice that of those with >16 C. Finally, we found an association between mortality and the location of the province (coastal/inland), altitude, patient age and the average air temperature; the latter was inversely and independently correlated with mortality (non-standardized beta coeff.: -0.24; 95%CI: -0.31 to -0.16; P=2.38x10-8). CONCLUSIONS: The average air temperature was inversely associated with COVID-19 mortality in our country during the first three waves of the pandemic.
36330512 | Editorial: CCR5: A receptor at the center stage in infection. 
36404927 | Beneficial effects of CCL8 inhibition at lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury. CCL8 (MCP-2) is a chemoattractive cytokine associated with various immune-related pathologies. Recent studies show that CCL8 is significantly stimulated during acute respiratory distress syndrome in severely ill patients with COVID-19, making the inhibition of CCL8 activity a promising treatment. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury was evaluated in mice using a neutralizing antibody (1G3E5) against human CCL8. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that following IP administration, 1G3E5 was sustained at higher levels and for a longer period compared to IV administration. CCL8 expression in the lungs was not enhanced by LPS, but CCR2 and CCR5 receptors were significantly stimulated. 1G3E5-mediated inhibition of CCL8 was associated with the reduction of pulmonary inflammation and suppression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results point to a previously unrecognized, permissive role for CCL8 in mediating cytokine induction and ultimately sustaining inflammation. Disruption of CCL8 activity may provide a strategy for mitigating pulmonary inflammation during lung injury when related to abnormal cytokine induction.
36506032 | Molecular docking and molecular dynamics study Lianhua Qingwen granules (LHQW) treats COVID-19 by inhibiting inflammatory response and regulating cell survival. Purpose: 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is endangering health of populations worldwide. Latest research has proved that Lianhua Qingwen granules (LHQW) can reduce tissue damage caused by inflammatory reactions and relieve patients' clinical symptoms. However, the mechanism of LHQW treats COVID-19 is currently lacking. Therefore, we employed computer simulations to investigate the mechanism of LHQW treats COVID-19 by modulating inflammatory response. Methods: We employed bioinformatics to screen active ingredients in LHQW and intersection gene targets. PPI, GO and KEGG was used to analyze relationship of intersection gene targets. Molecular dynamics simulations validated the binding stability of active ingredients and target proteins. Binding free energy, radius of gyration and the solvent accessible surface area were analyzed by supercomputer platform. Results: COVID-19 had 4628 gene targets, LHQW had 1409 gene targets, intersection gene targets were 415. Bioinformatics analysis showed that intersection targets were closely related to inflammation and immunomodulatory. Molecular docking suggested that active ingredients (including: licopyranocoumarin, Glycyrol and 3-3-Oxopropanoic acid) in LHQW played a role in treating COVID-19 by acting on CSF2, CXCL8, CCR5, NLRP3, IFNG and TNF. Molecular dynamics was used to prove the binding stability of active ingredients and protein targets. Conclusion: The mechanism of active ingredients in LHQW treats COVID-19 was investigated by computer simulations. We found that active ingredients in LHQW not only reduce cell damage and tissue destruction by inhibiting the inflammatory response through CSF2, CXCL8, CCR5 and IFNG, but also regulate cell survival and growth through NLRP3 and TNF thereby reducing apoptosis.
36521430 | Identification of key genes from the visceral adipose tissues of overweight/obese adults with hypertension through transcriptome sequencing. Overweight and obese (OW/OB) adults are at increased risk of hypertension due to visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation. In this study, we explored gene level differences in the VAT of hypertensive and normotensive OW/OB patients. VAT samples obtained from six OW/OB adults (three hypertensive, three normotensive) were subjected to transcriptome sequencing analysis. Gene set enrichment analysis was conducted for all gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with  log2 (fold change)  >= 1 and q < 0.05. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analyses were performed on the DEGs and hub genes were identified by constructing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The proposed hub genes were validated using quantitative real-time PCR in ten other samples from five hypertensive and five normotensive patients. In addition, we performed ROC analysis and spearman correlation analysis. A total of 84 DEGs were identified between VAT samples from OW/OB patients with and without hypertension, among which 21 were significantly up-regulated and 63 were significantly down-regulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that spleen function was related to hypertension in OW/OB adults. Meanwhile, PPI network analysis identified the following top 10 hub genes: CD79A, CR2, SELL, CD22, IL7R, CCR7, TNFRSF13C, CXCR4, POU2AF1, and JAK3. Through qPCR verification, we found that CXCR4, CD22 and IL7R were statistically significant. QPCR verification suggested that RELA were statistically significant. However, qPCR verification indicated that NF-KB1 and KLF2 were not statistically significant. These hub genes were mainly regulated by the transcription factors RELA. The AUC of ROC analysis for CXCR4, IL7R and CD22 was 0.92. What's more, VAT CXCR4 and CD22 were positively related to RELA relative expression levels. Take together, our research demonstrates that CXCR4, IL7R and CD22 related to VAT in hypertensive OW/OB adults could serve as future therapeutic targets.
36559044 | Biologic Functions of Hydroxychloroquine in Disease: From COVID-19 to Cancer. Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), initially utilized in the treatment of malaria, have now developed a long list of applications. Despite their clinical relevance, their mechanisms of action are not clearly defined. Major pathways by which these agents are proposed to function include alkalinization of lysosomes and endosomes, downregulation of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) expression, high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) inhibition, alteration of intracellular calcium, and prevention of thrombus formation. However, there is conflicting data present in the literature. This is likely the result of the complex overlapping pathways between these mechanisms of action that have not previously been highlighted. In fact, prior research has focused on very specific portions of particular pathways without describing these in the context of the extensive CQ/HCQ literature. This review summarizes the detailed data regarding CQ/HCQ's mechanisms of action while also providing insight into the overarching themes. Furthermore, this review provides clinical context to the application of these diverse drugs including their role in malaria, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, thrombus formation, malignancies, and viral infections.
36617676 | Description of the novel HLA-C allele, HLA-C*12:376, identified in a deceased COVID-19 patient. The new allele HLA-C*12:376 showed one nonsynonymous nucleotide difference compared with the C*12:03:01:01 allele in codon 30.
36692327 | Changing Disease Course of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Children, Turkey. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), endemic in certain regions of the world, is listed as a priority disease with pandemic potential. Since CCHF was first identified in Turkey, children have been known to experience milder disease than adults. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed an unusually severe disease course, including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We examined cytokine/chemokine profiles of 9/12 case-patients compared with healthy controls at 3 time intervals. Interferon pathway-related cytokines/chemokines, including interleukin (IL) 18, macrophage inflammatory protein 3alpha, and IL-33, were elevated, but tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, CXCL8 (formerly IL-8), and cytokines acting through C-C chemokine receptor 2 and CCR5 were lower among case-patients than controls. Interferon pathway activation and cytokines/chemokines acting through CCR2 and CCR5 improved health results among children with severe CCHF. Children can experience severe CCHF, including HLH, and HLH secondary to CCHF can be successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroid therapy.
36702907 | Galectin-3 as an important prognostic marker for COVID-19 severity. Galectin-3 (Gal-3), multifunctional protein plays important roles in inflammatory response, infection and fibrosis. The goal of study was to determine the association of Gal-3, immune response, clinical, biochemical, and radiographic findings with COVID-19 severity. Study included 280 COVID-19 patients classified according to disease severity into mild, moderate, severe and critical group. Cytokines, clinical, biochemical, radiographic data and peripheral blood immune cell make up were analyzed. Patients in critical group had significantly higher serum level of Gal-3, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-10 compared to the patients in less severe stages of disease. Strong positive correlation was detected between Gal-3 and IL-1beta, moderate positive correlation between Gal-3, TNF-alpha and IL-12, moderate negative correlation between Gal-3, IL-10/IL-1beta and IL-10/TNF-alpha. Moderate positive correlation noted between Gal-3 and urea, D dimer, CXR findings. Strong negative correlation detected between Gal-3 and p02, Sa02, and moderate negative correlation between Gal-3, lymphocyte and monocyte percentage. In the peripheral blood of patients with more severe stages of COVID-19 we detected significantly increased percentages of CD56- CD3+TNF-alpha+T cells and CD56- CD3+Gal-3+T cells and increased expression of CCR5 in PBMCs. Our results predict Gal-3 as an important marker for critical stage of COVID-19. Higher expression of Gal-3, TNF-alpha and CCR5 on T cells implicate on promoting inflammation and more severe form of disease.
36741450 | No association of a risk variant for severe COVID-19 with HIV protection in three cohorts of highly exposed individuals. An extended haplotype on chromosome 3 is the major genetic risk factor for severe COVID-19. The risk haplotype, which was inherited from Neanderthals, decreases the expression of several cytokine receptors, including CCR5. Recently, a study based on three general population cohorts indicated that the minor allele of one of the variants in the haplotype (rs17713054) protects against HIV infection. We thus expected this allele to be over-represented in highly exposed individuals who remain uninfected (exposed seronegative individuals, ESN). To perform a meta-analysis, we genotyped rs17713054 in three ESN cohorts of European ancestry exposed to HIV through different routes. No evidence of association was detected in the single cohorts. The meta-analysis also failed to detect any effect of the variant on protection from HIV-1. The same results were obtained in a Cox-regression analysis for the time to seroconversion. An in-vitro infection assay did not detect differences in viral replication as a function of rs17713054 genotype status. We conclude that the rs17713054 minor allele is not associated with the ESN phenotype and does not modulate HIV infection in vitro.
36972468 | Identification and Investigation of a Cryptic Binding Pocket of the P37 Envelope Protein of Monkeypox Virus by Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The spread of the monkeypox virus has surged during the unchecked COVID-19 epidemic. The most crucial target is the viral envelope protein, p37. However, lacking p37's crystal structure is a significant hurdle to rapid therapeutic discovery and mechanism elucidation. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) of the enzyme with inhibitors reveal a cryptic pocket occluded in the unbound structure. For the first time, the inhibitor's dynamic flip from the active to the cryptic site enlightens p37's allosteric site, which squeezes the active site, impairing its function. A large force is needed for inhibitor dissociation from the allosteric site, ushering in its biological importance. In addition, hot spot residues identified at both locations and discovered drugs more potent than tecovirimat may enable even more robust inhibitor designs against p37 and accelerate the development of monkeypox therapies.
37113113 | Influence of meteorological factors on the severity of COVID-19 in Spain: Observational ecological study. Objectives: Evaluating whether meteorological and geographical variables could be associated with the severity of COVID-19 in Spain. Methods: An ecological study was performed to analyze the influence of meteorological and geographical factors in hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19 in the 52 provinces of Spain (24 coastal and 28 inland regions), during the first three pandemic waves. Medical and mortality data were collected from the Carlos III Health Institute (ISCIII) and meteorological variables were requested to the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). Results: Regarding the diagnosed cases it is remarkable that the percentage of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was lower in the coastal provinces than in the inland ones (8.7 +- 2.6% vs. 11.5 +- 2.6%; p = 9.9 x 10-5). Furthermore, coastal regions registered a lower percentage of mortality than inland regions (2.0 +- 0.6% vs. 3.1 +- 0.8%; p = 1.7 x 10-5). Mean air temperature was inversely correlated both with COVID-19 hospitalizations (Rho: -0.59; p = 3.0 x 10-6) and mortality (Rho: -0.70; p = 5.3 x 10-9). In those provinces with a mean air temperature <10  C mortality by COVID-19 was twice that of those with >16  C. Finally, we found an association between mortality and the location of the province (coastal/inland), altitude, patient age and the average air temperature; the latter was inversely and independently correlated with mortality (non standardised B coeff.: -0.24; IC 95%: -0.31 to -0.16; p = 2.38 x 10-8). Conclusions: The average air temperature was inversely associated with COVID-19 mortality in our country during the first three waves of the pandemic.
37291167 | Bioinformatics and system biology approach to identify potential common pathogenesis for COVID-19 infection and osteoarthritis. A growing of evidence has showed that patients with osteoarthritis (OA) had a higher coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection rate and a poorer prognosis after infected it. Additionally, scientists have also discovered that COVID-19 infection might cause pathological changes in the musculoskeletal system. However, its mechanism is still not fully elucidated. This study aims to further explore the sharing pathogenesis of patients with both OA and COVID-19 infection and find candidate drugs. Gene expression profiles of OA (GSE51588) and COVID-19 (GSE147507) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both OA and COVID-19 were identified and several hub genes were extracted from them. Then gene and pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs were performed; protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, transcription factor (TF)-gene regulatory network, TF-miRNA regulatory network and gene-disease association network were constructed based on the DEGs and hub genes. Finally, we predicted several candidate molecular drugs related to hub genes using DSigDB database. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was applied to evaluate the accuracy of hub genes in the diagnosis of both OA and COVID-19. In total, 83 overlapping DEGs were identified and selected for subsequent analyses. CXCR4, EGR2, ENO1, FASN, GATA6, HIST1H3H, HIST1H4H, HIST1H4I, HIST1H4K, MTHFD2, PDK1, TUBA4A, TUBB1 and TUBB3 were screened out as hub genes, and some showed preferable values as diagnostic markers for both OA and COVID-19. Several candidate molecular drugs, which are related to the hug genes, were identified. These sharing pathways and hub genes may provide new ideas for further mechanistic studies and guide more individual-based effective treatments for OA patients with COVID-19 infection.
37457560 | Exploring potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Background: The negative impact of long COVID on social life and human health is increasingly prominent, and the elevated risk of cardiovascular disease in patients recovering from COVID-19 has also been fully confirmed. However, the pathogenesis of long COVID-related inflammatory cardiomyopathy is still unclear. Here, we explore potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets of long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Methods: Datasets that met the study requirements were identified in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by the algorithm. Then, functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the basic molecular mechanisms and biological processes associated with DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed to identify hub genes among the common DEGs. Finally, a third dataset was introduced for validation. Results: Ultimately, 3,098 upregulated DEGs and 1965 downregulated DEGs were extracted from the inflammatory cardiomyopathy dataset. A total of 89 upregulated DEGs and 217 downregulated DEGs were extracted from the dataset of convalescent COVID patients. Enrichment analysis and construction of the PPI network confirmed VEGFA, FOXO1, CXCR4, and SMAD4 as upregulated hub genes and KRAS and TXN as downregulated hub genes. The separate dataset of patients with COVID-19 infection used for verification led to speculation that long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy is mainly attributable to the immune-mediated response and inflammation rather than to direct infection of cells by the virus. Conclusion: Screening of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets sheds new light on the pathogenesis of long COVID-associated inflammatory cardiomyopathy as well as potential therapeutic approaches. Further clinical studies are needed to explore these possibilities in light of the increasingly severe negative impacts of long COVID.
37505242 | Proteolytic inactivation of CXCL12 in the lungs and circulation of COVID-19 patients. The human chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) or CXCL12 is involved in several homeostatic processes and pathologies through interaction with its cognate G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4. Recent research has shown that CXCL12 is present in the lungs and circulation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the question whether the detected CXCL12 is bioactive was not addressed. Indeed, the activity of CXCL12 is regulated by NH2- and COOH-terminal post-translational proteolysis, which significantly impairs its biological activity. The aim of the present study was to characterize proteolytic processing of CXCL12 in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and blood plasma samples from critically ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we optimized immunosorbent tandem mass spectrometry proteoform analysis (ISTAMPA) for detection of CXCL12 proteoforms. In patient samples, this approach uncovered that CXCL12 is rapidly processed by site-specific NH2- and COOH-terminal proteolysis and ultimately degraded. This proteolytic inactivation occurred more rapidly in COVID-19 plasma than in COVID-19 BAL fluids, whereas BAL fluid samples from stable lung transplantation patients and the non-affected lung of lung cancer patients (control groups) hardly induced any processing of CXCL12. In COVID-19 BAL fluids with high proteolytic activity, processing occurred exclusively NH2-terminally and was predominantly mediated by neutrophil elastase. In low proteolytic activity BAL fluid and plasma samples, NH2- and COOH-terminal proteolysis by CD26 and carboxypeptidases were observed. Finally, protease inhibitors already approved for clinical use such as sitagliptin and sivelestat prevented CXCL12 processing and may therefore be of pharmacological interest to prolong CXCL12 half-life and biological activity in vivo.
37531383 | Hydroxychloroquine reduces T cells activation recall antigen responses. BACKGROUND: In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is still limited information about how people suffering from autoimmune diseases respond to the different COVID vaccines. The fact that they are taking an immunosuppressant or other drugs that aim to decrease the immune system activities, such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), could also impact their ability to respond to a COVID vaccine and vaccines in general. METHODS: Heathy donors were given 200mg of HCQ daily for 6-weeks to assess HCQs impact on the systemic T cells and humoral immune response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma were obtained at baseline and 6-weeks after starting daily HCQ. Flow cytometry assays were designed to determine changes in T cell activation and T cell responses. Bead array multiplex were used to analyse antibodies and cytokine levels before and after HCQ intake. RESULTS: As anticipated, HCQ treatment decreased ex vivo T cell activation. We observed a decrease in CD4+CD161- expressing CCR5 (p = 0.015) and CD69 (p = 0.004) as well as in CD8+CCR5+ (p = 0.003), CD8+CD161+CCR5+ (p = 0.002) and CD8+CD161+CD95+ (p = 0.004). Additionally, HCQ decreased the proportion of Th17 expressing CD29 (p = 0.019), a subset associated with persistent inflammation. The proportion of T regulatory cells expressing the inhibitory molecule TIGIT was also reduced by HCQ (p = 0.003). As well, T cells from people on HCQ were less responsive to activation and cytokine production following stimulation with recall antigens and memory T cells were less likely to produce both IFNgamma and TNFalpha following stimulation. CONCLUSION: This study shows HCQ is associated with lower T cell activation and decreased T cell cytokine production. While this study was not performed with the intent of looking at COVID vaccine response, it does provide important information about the changes in immune response that may occur in patient taking HCQ as a treatment for their autoimmune disease.
37690961 | HLA alleles: important pieces to the COVID-19 puzzle. Research on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raised high expectations but has yielded limited results. Augusto et al.'s recent study in Nature unveils a strong association of HLA-B*15:01 with asymptomatic COVID-19, representing an important contribution to genetics in COVID-19.
37725104 | Featured immune characteristics of COVID-19 and systemic lupus erythematosus revealed by multidimensional integrated analyses. BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shares similar immune characteristics with autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, such associations have not yet been investigated at the single-cell level. METHODS: We integrated and analyzed RNA sequencing results from different patients and normal controls from the GEO database and identified subsets of immune cells that might involve in the pathogenesis of SLE and COVID- 19. We also disentangled the characteristic alterations in cell and molecular subset proportions as well as gene expression patterns in SLE patients compared with COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Key immune characteristic genes (such as CXCL10 and RACK1) and multiple immune-related pathways (such as the coronavirus disease-COVID-19, T-cell receptor signaling, and MIF-related signaling pathways) were identified. We also highlighted the differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) between SLE and COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we provided an opportunity to comprehensively probe underlying B-cell-cell communication with multiple ligand-receptor pairs (MIF-CD74+CXCR4, MIF-CD74+CD44) and the differentiation trajectory of B-cell clusters that is deemed to promote cell state transitions in COVID-19 and SLE. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the immune response differences and immune characteristic similarities, such as the cytokine storm, between COVID-19 and SLE, which might pivotally function in the pathogenesis of the two diseases and provide potential intervention targets for both diseases.
37851747 | HLA haplotypes and differential regional mortality caused by COVID-19 in Brazil: an ecological study based on a large bone marrow donor bank dataset. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality rates varied among the states of Brazil during the course of the pandemics. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a critical component of the antigen presentation pathway. Individuals with different HLA genotypes may trigger different immune responses against pathogens, which could culminate in different COVID-19 responses. HLA genotypes are variable, especially in the highly admixed Brazilian population. In this ecological study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between HLA haplotypes and the different regional distribution of COVID-19 mortality in Brazil. HLA data was obtained from 4,148,713 individuals registered in The Brazilian Voluntary Bone Marrow Donors Registry. COVID-19 data was retrieved from epidemiological bulletins issued by State Health Secretariats via Brazil's Ministry of Health from February/2020 to July/2022. We found a positive significant correlation between the HLA-A*01~B*08~DRB1*03 haplotype and COVID-19 mortality rates when we analyzed data from 26 states and the Federal District. This result indicates that the HLA-A*01~B*08~DRB1*03 haplotype may represent an additional risk factor for dying due to COVID-19. This haplotype should be further studied in other populations for a better understanding of the variation in COVID-19 outcomes across the world.
38012279 | A web-based genome-wide association study reveals the susceptibility loci of common adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination in the Japanese population. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide. To prevent its spread, mRNA-based vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b1) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) have been widely used, including in Japan. Various adverse events have been reported following the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with differences observed among individuals. However, analyses of the genetic background associated with the susceptibility to side effects have been limited. In the present study, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for self-reported adverse events of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccination in 4545 Japanese individuals and identified 14 associated loci. Among these, 6p21 was associated with 37.5  C or higher fever, 38  C or higher fever, and muscle pain. HLA allele association analysis revealed that various HLA alleles were associated with the adverse effects; HLA-DQA1*03:01 and HLA-A*11:01 were more reliably associated with the adverse effects. Our results may enable the preparation and management of adverse effects by identifying the susceptibility to these adverse events. Furthermore, we obtained valuable data that may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.
38017505 | C-C chemokine receptor 5 is essential for conventional NK cell trafficking and liver injury in a murine hepatitis virus-induced fulminant hepatic failure model. BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells migrated into the liver from peripheral organs and exerted cytotoxic effects on hepatocytes in virus-induced liver failure. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic role of chemokine receptors in the migration of NK cells in a murine hepatitis  virus strain 3 (MHV-3)-induced fulminant hepatic failure (MHV-3-FHF) model and its mechanism. RESULTS: By gene array analysis, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) was found to have remarkably elevated expression levels in hepatic NK cells after MHV-3 infection. The number of hepatic CCR5+ conventional NK (cNK) cells increased and peaked at 48 h after MHV-3 infection, while the number of hepatic resident NK (rNK) cells steadily declined. Moreover, the expression of CCR5-related chemokines, including macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) was significantly upregulated in MHV-3-infected hepatocytes. In an in vitro Transwell migration assay, CCR5-blocked splenic cNK cells showed decreased migration towards MHV-3-infected hepatocytes, and inhibition of MIP-1beta or RANTES but not MIP-1alpha decreased cNK cell migration. Moreover, CCR5 knockout (KO) mice displayed reduced infiltration of hepatic cNK cells after MHV-3 infection, accompanied by attenuated liver injury and improved mouse survival time. Adoptive transfer of cNK cells from wild-type mice into CCR5 KO mice resulted in the abundant accumulation of hepatic cNK cells and aggravated liver injury. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of CCR5 by maraviroc reduced cNK cell infiltration in the liver and liver injury in the MHV-3-FHF model. CONCLUSION: The CCR5-MIP-1beta/RANTES axis played a critical role in the recruitment of cNK cells to the liver during MHV-3-induced liver injury. Targeted inhibition of CCR5 provides a therapeutic approach to ameliorate liver damage during virus-induced acute liver injury.
38071404 | HLA binding-groove motifs are associated with myocarditis induction after Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We found a higher incidence of myocarditis in young males who had received at least two Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccinations. The human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are known to play an important role in infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that certain HLA alleles might be associated with vaccination-induced myocarditis. METHODS: HLA typing was performed using next-generation sequencing technology with the Illumina Iseq100 platform. HLA class I and II loci were genotyped in 29 patients with post-vaccination myocarditis and compared with HLA data from 300 healthy controls. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the DRB1*14:01, DRB1*15:03 alleles and the motifs in HLA-A - Leu62 and Gln63, which are part of binding pocket B and HLA-DR Tyr47, His60, Arg70 and Glu74, which are part of binding pockets P4, P7 and P9, were significantly associated with disease susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that immunogenetic fingerprints in HLA peptide-binding grooves may affect the presentation of peptides derived from the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination to T cells and induce an inflammatory process that results in myocarditis.
38231284 | The demographic, laboratory and genetic factors associated with long Covid-19 syndrome: a case-control study. Long Covid-19 syndrome (LCS) manifests with a wide range of clinical symptoms, yet the factors associated with LCS remain poorly understood. The current study aimed to investigate the relationships that demographic characteristics, clinical history, laboratory indicators, and the frequency of HLA-I alleles have with the likelihood of developing LCS. We extracted the demographic characteristics and clinical histories from the medical records of 88 LCS cases (LCS+ group) and 96 individuals without LCS (LCS- group). Furthermore, we evaluated the clinical symptoms, serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, laboratory parameters, and the frequencies of HLA-I alleles. Following this we used multiple logistic regression to investigate the association these variables had with LCS. Subjects in the LCS+ group were more likely to have experienced severe Covid-19 symptoms and had higher body mass index (BMI), white blood cell, lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-6 levels than those in the LCS- group (for all: P < 0.05). Moreover, the frequencies of the HLA-A*11, -B*14, -B*38, -B*50, and -C*07 alleles were higher in the LCS+ group (for all: P < 0.05). After adjusting for the most important variables, the likelihood of suffering from LCS was significantly associated with BMI, CRP, IL-6, the HLA-A*11, and -C*07 alleles, as well as a positive history of severe Covid-19 (for all: P < 0.05). Our study showed that a history of severe Covid-19 during the acute phase of the disease, the HLA-A*11, and -C*07 alleles, higher BMI, as well as elevated serum CRP and IL-6 levels, were all associated with an increased likelihood of LCS.
38301089 | Influence of HLA-A, -B, -DR Polymorphisms on the Severity of COVID-19: A Case-Control Study in the Iranian Population. BACKGROUND: As an emerging pandemic disease, COVID-19 encompasses a spectrum of clinical diagnoses, from the common cold to severe respiratory syndrome. Considering the shreds of evidence demonstrating the relationship between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele diversity and infectious disease susceptibility, this study was conducted to determine the association of HLA alleles with COVID-19 severity in Iranian subjects. METHODS: In this case-control study, a total of 200 unrelated individuals (consisting of 100 people with severe COVID-19 and an average age of 55.54 as the case group, and 100 patients with mild COVID-19 with an average age of 48.97 as the control group) were recruited, and HLA typing (Locus A, B, and DR) was performed using the Olerup sequence-specific oligonucleotide (SSO) HLA-typing kit. RESULTS: Our results showed that HLA-A*11 and HLA-DRB1*14 alleles were more frequently observed in severe COVID-19 cases, while HLA-B*52 was more common in mild cases, which was in agreement with some previous studies. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the evidence for the association of HLA alleles with COVID-19 outcomes. We found that HLA-A*11 and HLA-DRB1*14 alleles may be susceptibility factors for severe COVID-19, while HLA-B*52 may be a protective factor. These findings provide new insight into the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and help patient management.
38632561 | Quantifying the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on hospital admissions forecasts: COVID-19 in England, September 2020-April 2021. BACKGROUND: Defining healthcare facility catchment areas is a key step in predicting future healthcare demand in epidemic settings. Forecasts of hospitalisations can be informed by leading indicators measured at the community level. However, this relies on the definition of so-called catchment areas or the geographies whose populations make up the patients admitted to a given hospital, which are often not well-defined. Little work has been done to quantify the impact of hospital catchment area definitions on healthcare demand forecasting. METHODS: We made forecasts of local-level hospital admissions using a scaled convolution of local cases (as defined by the hospital catchment area) and delay distribution. Hospital catchment area definitions were derived from either simple heuristics (in which people are admitted to their nearest hospital or any nearby hospital) or historical admissions data (all emergency or elective admissions in 2019, or COVID-19 admissions), plus a marginal baseline definition based on the distribution of all hospital admissions. We evaluated predictive performance using each hospital catchment area definition using the weighted interval score and considered how this changed by the length of the predictive horizon, the date on which the forecast was made, and by location. We also considered the change, if any, in the relative performance of each definition in retrospective vs. real-time settings, or at different spatial scales. RESULTS: The choice of hospital catchment area definition affected the accuracy of hospital admission forecasts. The definition based on COVID-19 admissions data resulted in the most accurate forecasts at both a 7- and 14-day horizon and was one of the top two best-performing definitions across forecast dates and locations. The \nearby\ heuristic also performed well, but less consistently than the COVID-19 data definition. The marginal distribution baseline, which did not include any spatial information, was the lowest-ranked definition. The relative performance of the definitions was larger when using case forecasts compared to future observed cases. All results were consistent across spatial scales of the catchment area definitions. CONCLUSIONS: Using catchment area definitions derived from context-specific data can improve local-level hospital admission forecasts. Where context-specific data is not available, using catchment areas defined by carefully chosen heuristics is a sufficiently good substitute. There is clear value in understanding what drives local admissions patterns, and further research is needed to understand the impact of different catchment area definitions on forecast performance where case trends are more heterogeneous.
38633920 | Influence of Sociodemographic Factors on Stunting, Wasting, and Underweight Among Children Under Two Years of Age Born During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Central India: A Cross-Sectional Study. Introduction The adverse effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on maternal and reproductive health extend beyond the immediate morbidity and mortality attributed directly to the disease. Pandemic-induced disruptions in the healthcare, social and economic infrastructures can exacerbate the already high burden of childhood undernutrition in India. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in a selected district of the central Indian province of Madhya Pradesh. Data was collected from eligible children born during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 2020 to December 2021) who visited a selected tertiary care hospital for routine immunization during the study period. Weight-for-length, weight-for-age, and length-for-age were compared with reference values to obtain corresponding z-scores. Children with z-scores two standard deviations below the reference values were considered wasting, underweight and stunting, respectively. Descriptive statistics were employed to summarise the sociodemographic characteristics of participants. The association of sociodemographic, nutritional, and pregnancy-related factors with the z-scores were assessed via unpaired t-test and ANOVA. Result The studied 147 children were in the age group of nine to 29 months, of which 61 (58.1%) were males. Forty-two (28.6%) were found to be underweight, 22 (14.9%) had wasting and 51 (34.7%) were stunted. These prevalences were comparable to the estimates of the National Family Health Survey 2019-2021 (NFHS-5) for Madhya Pradesh and lower than the NFHS-4 (2015-2016), showing no discernible effect of being born during the pandemic on growth indicators. However, mothers' employment and family income were independent predictors of stunting whereas gestational age at birth, maternal education, and prolonged breastfeeding were all substantially linked with wasting in this study. Conclusion This study adds to the evidence base by reporting the prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight along with their determinants in central India among children born during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data did not reflect the expected increase in child malnutrition due to the COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare, social and economic infrastructure. Future research should incorporate the lessons learnt from our study to design a population-based study of under-five children and compare the prevalence of undernutrition in pandemic-born versus non-pandemic-born children.
38633947 | Characteristics of Patients With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency From Rural Appalachia: A Retrospective Single-Center Study. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, an autosomal co-dominant inherited condition, significantly impacts lung and liver functions, with mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, notably the Z allele, playing a pivotal role in disease susceptibility. This retrospective descriptive study from a rural Eastern Kentucky pulmonary clinic aimed to characterize patients with AAT deficiency, focusing on demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters extracted from electronic health records (EHR) of Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH). Among 100 patient encounters, 56 were analyzed, revealing notable sex-based differences in smoking rates and co-existing conditions, with males showing higher rates of black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In comparison, females exhibited higher rates of asthma, COVID-19, pneumothorax, and obstructive sleep apnea. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding genotype-phenotype correlations and demographic factors in assessing AAT deficiency, advocating for further research to refine management strategies and elucidate causal relationships.
38646408 | Efficacy of Original Neurofeedback Treatment Method for Brain Fog From COVID-19: A Case Report. Brain fog is one of the most well-known sequelae of long COVID. It causes cognitive problems, mostly short-term memory disturbances, attention impairments, and problems with concentration. Although trials for treatment methods for brain fog have been carried out worldwide, effective methods have not yet been reported. Neurofeedback is effective for several common disorders and symptoms, including anxiety, depression, headaches, and pain. Neurofeedback is also reported to improve cognitive functions, such as processing speed and executive functions, including attention, planning, organization, problem-solving, and performance. Furthermore, neurofeedback is effective for \chemofog\ and \chemobrain,\ which occur after chemotherapy and cause cognitive impairments in a similar manner to brain fog. However, there have been no reports of neurofeedback treatments for brain fog. Therefore, we have started to develop an original neurofeedback treatment method for brain fog using a Z-score neurofeedback technique. In this study, we present the first case report of a patient who has successfully recovered from brain fog via neurofeedback. Pain and psychological assessments revealed that the patient's pain improved and that the patient recovered from anxiety. Electroencephalograph data revealed several noble findings. C4 was thought to be the most affected site by brain fog, and this improved after treatment. The percentage increase at alpha wavelengths increased at almost all sites, and beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and Hi beta decreased at almost all sites. The increased values at theta and alpha wavelengths after the 1st and 2nd sessions and the decreased values at higher beta wavelengths, such as beta 3 and Hi beta, were shown at all sessions.
8053246 | [Complications in transvenous and transvenous-subcutaneous implantable defibrillator systems]. Due to technical improvement using the transvenous-subcutaneous approach for lead fixation for cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, the incidence of device implantation has extended enormously. While a significant lower perioperative mortality in transvenously implanted systems compared to epicardially fixed implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been proven, perioperative as well as complications during follow-up are not analyzed systematically. In 59 patients, in whom transvenous-subcutaneous ICDs had been implanted, 3 patients showed bleeding complications in the subcutaneous patch area, 1 patient showed a bleeding in the device pocket, and in 1 patient a seroma in the subcutaneous patch region was observed necessitating surgical revisions. During follow-up of 10 +/- 7 months, lead dislocations were observed in 6 patients, in another 6 patients patch crinkling was observed. There was 1 patient with a lead fracture as well as 1 patient with a bleeding in the subcutaneous patch region. Despite the high efficacy of this therapy used in patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, these potential complications have to be considered.
12909101 | Development of a new method for the determination of nitrosamines by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography. A new method was developed for separation and quantification of nitrosamines by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC). The effects of composition of the buffer, concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), gamma-cyclodextrin (CD) and pH on the separation and migration times of the nitrosamines were investigated. The different instrumental variables affecting sensitivity and resolution, such as power supply, injection mode and wavelength for measurement, were carefully optimized. The direct application of this method to aqueous synthetic samples allowed the separation and determination of nitrosamine mixtures at the mg x L(-1) level. The calibration curves revealed a linear range between 0.25 and 10 mg x L(-1), with detection limit (DL) varying from 0.16 to 0.27 mg x L(-1), quantification limit (QL) varying from 0.52 to 0.90 mg x L(-1), and RSD relative standard deviation (RSD) from 4.5% to 8.5%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), diethylnitrosamine (DEN), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP).
16175134 | Quantitative analysis of the immunosuppressant CP-690,550 in whole blood by column-switching high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry detection. A fast and accurate method to quantify the new immunosuppressive JAK3 inhibitor CP-690,550 in whole blood using a dual-pump liquid chromatography-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS) system was developed and validated in nonhuman primate blood. Before injection, blood samples were prepared by precipitation with a reagent that included methanol and acetonitrile (30:70, vol/vol) along with the internal standard (CP-istd). Column-switching LC/LC-MS analysis used online extraction followed by separation on a C8 analytic column and MS detection of the [M + H] CP-690,550 (m/z = 313.1) and CP internal standard (m/z = 288.1). Linearity was always better than r = 0.99 (n = 7) for CP-690,550 (range 2.5-750 ng/mL), with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 2.5 ng/mL. The intrarun accuracy and precision ranged from 103.0% to 105.4% and 2.7% to 4.3%, respectively (n = 5), and the interday precision ranged from 8.7% to 11.1%, and the interday accuracy ranged from 98.1% to 103.8% of nominal values (n = 14). The injection repeatability for the method was 1.3% (n = 7). Except for the LLOQ, the intraday accuracy and precision in human blood were also within 15% (n = 5). The combination of simple sample preparation and short analytic run time of this sensitive procedure makes it effective for monitoring the concentration of CP-690,550 in whole blood in organ-transplant recipients.
17764010 | Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-mediated recognition of human solid tumors. Potential for immunotherapy of hepatocellular and colorectal carcinomas. INTRODUCTION: Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes are reported to participate in the anti-tumor immune surveillance in human. They are known to recognize phosphoantigens and molecules expressed on cells undergoing neoplasic transformation. In this study, we investigated phenotype and anti-tumor cytotoxicity of ex vivo expanded Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells in view of adoptive immunotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experiments were performed with peripheral blood samples from eleven patients [six colorectal carcinoma (CRC), four hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one sarcoma] and sixteen healthy donors. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Ex vivo expansion of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells could be achieved by a single dose of phosphoantigen, either bromohydrin pyrophosphate or zoledronate, and supported by exogenous IL-2. After 2 weeks, expanded Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes acquired the effector memory phenotype CD45RA(-)CD45RO(high)CD27(-). They expressed NKG2D and CD161 and the proinflammatory CXCR3 and CCR5 chemokine receptors. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells displayed a strong lytic activity toward a broad panel of tumor cell lines or primary cultures. Interestingly, HCC and CRC primary cells could be lysed by autologous Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells whereas autologous normal cells were not sensitive to the lysis. mAbs blocking assays demonstrated that TCR was the most important receptor involved in the lysis of tumor cells. However, NKG2D receptor could deliver a costimulatory signal enhancing the lysis of HCC and CRC tumors expressing MICA/B. Treatment of tumor cells by the mevalonate pathway inhibitor, zoledronate, enhanced the killing of both HCC and CRC. Expansion index of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells was in similar levels in healthy donors or in cancer patients and total expansion was suitable for adoptive immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: These results provide a rationale for the clinical evaluation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes in HCC and CRC.
19009346 | Multiple Gi proteins participate in nerve growth factor-induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases in PC12 cells. Nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) is critical for differentiation and apoptosis of PC12 cells. Since NGF employs stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) to regulate both programmed cell death and neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, we examined NGF-regulated JNK activity and the role of G(i/o) proteins. Induction of JNK phosphorylation by NGF occurred in a time- and dose-dependent manner and was partially inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX). To discern the participation of various signaling intermediates, PC12 cells were treated with specific inhibitors prior to NGF challenge. NGF-elevated JNK activity was abolished by inhibitors of JNK, p38 MAPK, Src, JAK3 and MEK1/2. NGF-dependent JNK phosphorylation became insensitive to PTX treatment upon transient expressions of Galpha(z) or the PTX-resistant mutants of Galpha(i1-3) and Galpha(oA). Collectively, these studies indicate that NGF-dependent JNK activity may be mediated via G(i1-3) proteins, JAK3, Src, p38 MAPK and the MEK/ERK cascade.
19139883 | A possible mechanism of intravesical BCG therapy for human bladder carcinoma: involvement of innate effector cells for the inhibition of tumor growth. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is considered the most successful immunotherapy against solid tumors of human bladder carcinoma. To determine the actual effector cells activated by intravesical BCG therapy to inhibit the growth of bladder carcinoma, T24 human bladder tumor cells, expressing very low levels of class I MHC, were co-cultured with allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with live BCG. The proliferation of T24 cells was markedly inhibited when BCG-infected dendritic cells (DCs) were added to the culture although the addition of either BCG or uninfected DCs alone did not result in any inhibition. The inhibitory effect was much stronger when the DCs were infected with live BCG rather than with heat-inactivated BCG. The live BCG-infected DCs secreted TNF-alpha and IL-12 within a day and this secretion continued for at least a week, while the heat-inactivated BCG-infected DCs secreted no IL-12 and little TNF-alpha. Such secretion of cytokines may activate innate alert cells, and indeed NKT cells expressing IL-12 receptors apparently proliferated and were activated to produce cytocidal perforin among the PBMCs when live BCG-infected DCs were externally added. Moreover, depletion of gammadelta T-cells from PBMCs significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect on T24 cells, while depletion of CD8beta cells did not affect T24 cell growth. Furthermore, the innate effectors seem to recognize MICA/MICB molecules on T24 via NKG2D receptors. These findings suggest the involvement of innate alert cells activated by the live BCG-infected DCs to inhibit the growth of bladder carcinoma and provide a possible mechanism of intravesical BCG therapy.
21876034 | IL-2 regulates expression of C-MAF in human CD4 T cells. Blockade of IL-2R with humanized anti-CD25 Abs, such as daclizumab, inhibits Th2 responses in human T cells. Recent murine studies have shown that IL-2 also plays a significant role in regulating Th2 cell differentiation by activated STAT5. To explore the role of activated STAT5 in the Th2 differentiation of primary human T cells, we studied the mechanisms underlying IL-2 regulation of C-MAF expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that IL-2 induced STAT5 binding to specific sites in the C-MAF promoter. These sites corresponded to regions enriched for markers of chromatin architectural features in both resting CD4 and differentiated Th2 cells. Unlike IL-6, IL-2 induced C-MAF expression in CD4 T cells with or without prior TCR stimulation. TCR-induced C-MAF expression was significantly inhibited by treatment with daclizumab or a JAK3 inhibitor, R333. Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-6 synergistically induced C-MAF expression in TCR-activated T cells, suggesting functional cooperation between these cytokines. Finally, both TCR-induced early IL4 mRNA expression and IL-4 cytokine expression in differentiated Th2 cells were significantly inhibited by IL-2R blockade. Thus, our findings demonstrate the importance of IL-2 in Th2 differentiation in human T cells and support the notion that IL-2R-directed therapies may have utility in the treatment of allergic disorders.
23990909 | Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) 5 utilises distinct domains for regulation of JAK1 and interaction with the adaptor protein Shc-1. Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)5 is thought to act as a tumour suppressor through negative regulation of JAK/STAT and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling. However, the mechanism/s by which SOCS5 acts on these two distinct pathways is unclear. We show for the first time that SOCS5 can interact directly with JAK via a unique, conserved region in its N-terminus, which we have termed the JAK interaction region (JIR). Co-expression of SOCS5 was able to specifically reduce JAK1 and JAK2 (but not JAK3 or TYK2) autophosphorylation and this function required both the conserved JIR and additional sequences within the long SOCS5 N-terminal region. We further demonstrate that SOCS5 can directly inhibit JAK1 kinase activity, although its mechanism of action appears distinct from that of SOCS1 and SOCS3. In addition, we identify phosphoTyr317 in Shc-1 as a high-affinity substrate for the SOCS5-SH2 domain and suggest that SOCS5 may negatively regulate EGF and growth factor-driven Shc-1 signaling by binding to this site. These findings suggest that different domains in SOCS5 contribute to two distinct mechanisms for regulation of cytokine and growth factor signaling.
24291667 | Direct observation of cesium at the interlayer region in phlogopite mica. To investigate the sorption mechanism of cesium (Cs) into clay minerals, high-resolution (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM) imaging of Cs in mica (phlogopite) has been conducted. Platy phlogopite powders were immersed in a cesium chloride (CsCl) solution to achieve Cs(+)-K(+) ion-exchange at the interlayer regions in phlogopite. To observe many phlogopite particles with the incident electron beam parallel to the mica layers, cross-sectional thin specimens were prepared from sedimented particles using a focused ion beam. High-angle annular dark-field imaging with STEM is superior to conventional high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) for visualizing Cs at interlayer sites even in thicker crystal regions and/or at lower magnification due to the intense Z-contrast of Cs. However, HRTEM is also practical for estimating the concentration of Cs at the interlayer site from the thickness dependence of the contrast at the interlayer region. Cs sorption of micas was previously thought to be localized mainly at the frayed-edge sites of mica crystals. However, the present observations indicate that Cs substitution of K occurs not around crystal edges but deep inside the crystals along specific interlayer regions. 
24787765 | Two novel human cytomegalovirus NK cell evasion functions target MICA for lysosomal degradation. NKG2D plays a major role in controlling immune responses through the regulation of natural killer (NK) cells, alphabeta and gammadelta T-cell function. This activating receptor recognizes eight distinct ligands (the MHC Class I polypeptide-related sequences (MIC) A andB, and UL16-binding proteins (ULBP)1-6) induced by cellular stress to promote recognition cells perturbed by malignant transformation or microbial infection. Studies into human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) have aided both the identification and characterization of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs). HCMV immediate early (IE) gene up regulates NKGDLs, and we now describe the differential activation of ULBP2 and MICA/B by IE1 and IE2 respectively. Despite activation by IE functions, HCMV effectively suppressed cell surface expression of NKGDLs through both the early and late phases of infection. The immune evasion functions UL16, UL142, and microRNA(miR)-UL112 are known to target NKG2DLs. While infection with a UL16 deletion mutant caused the expected increase in MICB and ULBP2 cell surface expression, deletion of UL142 did not have a similar impact on its target, MICA. We therefore performed a systematic screen of the viral genome to search of addition functions that targeted MICA. US18 and US20 were identified as novel NK cell evasion functions capable of acting independently to promote MICA degradation by lysosomal degradation. The most dramatic effect on MICA expression was achieved when US18 and US20 acted in concert. US18 and US20 are the first members of the US12 gene family to have been assigned a function. The US12 family has 10 members encoded sequentially through US12-US21; a genetic arrangement, which is suggestive of an 'accordion' expansion of an ancestral gene in response to a selective pressure. This expansion must have be an ancient event as the whole family is conserved across simian cytomegaloviruses from old world monkeys. The evolutionary benefit bestowed by the combinatorial effect of US18 and US20 on MICA may have contributed to sustaining the US12 gene family. 
25060517 | Meta-analysis of the association between functional MICA-TM polymorphisms and systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A transmembrane (MICA-TM) polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted to establish the association between MICA-TM polymorphisms and SLE, RA and AS in the overall study population, as well as in each ethnic group. RESULTS: A total of 13 comparison studies, including five SLE (1601 patients; 1846 controls), four RA (701 patients; 887 controls) and four AS (346 patients; 356 controls) studies were considered in the meta-analysis. An association between the MICA-TM A5.1 allele and SLE was demonstrated in Europeans but not in Asians: odds ratio (OR) = 1.699, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.123-2.569, p = 0.012 and OR = 0.949, 95 % CI = 0.502-1.793, p = 0.871, respectively. However, no association was found in Europeans after Bonferroni correction (pcorrected = 0.060). An association was found between the MICA-TM A9 allele and RA in Asians (OR = 0.527, 95 % CI = 0.408-0.681, p = 8.9 x 10(-7)) but not in Europeans; the association in Asians remained significant after Bonferroni correction (pcorrected = 4.5 x 10(-6)). An association between the MICA-TM A4 phenotype and AS was observed in European and Asian populations (OR = 12.87, 95 % CI = 6.747-24.58, p < 1.0 x 10(-9) and OR = 9.461, 95 % CI = 5.754-15.55, p < 1.0 x 10(-9), respectively). Meta-analysis stratified by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 status revealed an association between the MICA-TM A4 phenotype and HLA-B27 positivity AS in Asians, but not in Europeans (OR = 0.318, 95 % CI = 0.102-0.995, p = 0.049 and OR = 2.080, 95 % CI = 0.422-10.25, p = 0.368, respectively). However, the association in Asians was not significant after Bonferroni correction (pcorrected = 0.245). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated that there was no association between MICA-TM polymorphisms and SLE susceptibility, but that the MICA-TM A9 allele was associated with an RA risk in Asians. Moreover, the association between the MICA-TM A4 phenotype and AS was HLA-B27-dependent.
25085142 | High-speed force mapping on living cells with a small cantilever atomic force microscope. The imaging speed of the wide-spread force mapping mode for quantitative mechanical measurements on soft samples in liquid with the atomic force microscope (AFM) is limited by the bandwidth of the z-scanner and viscous drag forces on the cantilever. Here, we applied high-speed, large scan-range atomic force microscopy and small cantilevers to increase the speed of force mapping by  10-100 times. This allowed resolving dynamic processes on living mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Cytoskeleton reorganization during cell locomotion, growth of individual cytoskeleton fibers, cell blebbing, and the formation of endocytic pits in the cell membrane were observed. Increasing the force curve rate from 2 to 300 Hz increased the measured apparent Young's modulus of the cells by about 10 times, which facilitated force mapping measurements at high speed. 
25806669 | Molecular Structure and Equilibrium Forces of Bovine Submaxillary Mucin Adsorbed at a Solid-Liquid Interface. By combining dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and surface force apparatus, the conformation of bovine submaxillary mucin in dilute solution and nanomechanical properties of mucin layers adsorbed on mica have been investigated. The samples were prepared by additional chromatographic purification of commercially available products. The mucin molecule was found to have a z-average hydrodynamic diameter of ca. 35 nm in phosphate buffered solution, without any particular secondary or tertiary structure. The contour length of the mucin is larger than, yet of the same order of magnitude as the diameter, indicating that the molecule can be modeled as a relatively rigid polymeric chain due to the large persistence length of the central glycosylated domain. Mucin molecules adsorbed abundantly onto mica from saline buffer, generating polymer-like, long-ranged, repulsive, and nonhysteretic forces upon compression of the adsorbed layers. Detailed analysis of such forces suggests that adsorbed mucins had an elongated conformation favored by the stiffness of the central domain. Acidification of aqueous media was chosen as means to reduce mucin-mucin and mucin-substrate electrostatic interactions. The hydrodynamic diameter in solution did not significantly change when the pH was lowered, showing that the large persistence length of the mucin molecule is due to steric hindrance between sugar chains, rather than electrostatic interactions. Remarkably, the force generated by an adsorbed layer with a fixed surface coverage also remained unaltered upon acidification. This observation can be linked to the surface-protective, pH-resistant role of bovine submaxillary mucin in the variable environmental conditions of the oral cavity. 
26184953 | Associations between major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A polymorphisms and susceptibility to Behcet's disease. A meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to investigate whether major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to Behcet's disease (BD). METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted on the associations between the MICA-transmembrane (TM) A6 allele and the 009 allele of MICA exon 2-4 (MICA*009) and BD with or without HLA-B51 overall and in each ethnic group. RESULTS: Fifteen comparison studies were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between the MICA-TM A6 allele and BD in European, Asian, and Arab populations [odds ratio (OR) 1.436, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.111-1.857, p = 0.006; OR 1.999, 95 % CI 1.551-2.575, p = 8.0 x 10(-8); OR 1.333, 95 % CI 1.058-2.300, p = 0.025, respectively,]). Stratification by HLA-B51 showed an association between the MICA-TM A6 allele and BD with HLA-B51 in the overall group and in the European population. Meta-analysis showed a significant association between the MICA*009 allele and BD in the overall group (OR 3.948, 95 % CI 2.680-5.815, p < 1.0 x 10(-8)) and in the European population (OR 3.392, 95 % CI 2.118-5.433, p = 5.6 x 10(-6)). A significant association was found between the MICA*009 allele and B51-positive BD. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that the MICA-TM A6 allele and the MICA*009 allele are associated with BD susceptibility in various ethnic populations, and that MICA alleles are in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-B51 in BD.
27338332 | Essential Oil Variation from Twenty Two Genotypes of Citrus in Brazil-Chemometric Approach and Repellency Against Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. The chemical composition of volatile oils from 22 genotypes of Citrus and related genera was poorly differentiated, but chemometric techniques have clarified the relationships between the 22 genotypes, and allowed us to understand their resistance to D. citri. The most convincing similarities include the synthesis of (Z)-beta-ocimene and (E)-caryophyllene for all 11 genotypes of group A. Genotypes of group B are not uniformly characterized by essential oil compounds. When stimulated with odor sources of 22 genotypes in a Y-tube olfactometer D. citri preferentially entered the arm containing the volatile oils of Murraya paniculata, confirming orange jasmine as its best host. C. reticulata x C. sinensis was the least preferred genotype, and is characterized by the presence of phytol, (Z)-beta-ocimene, and beta-elemene, which were not found in the most preferred genotype. We speculate that these three compounds may act as a repellent, making these oils less attractive to D. citri. 
27399676 | Protonation Sites, Tandem Mass Spectrometry and Computational Calculations of o-Carbonyl Carbazolequinone Derivatives. A series of a new type of tetracyclic carbazolequinones incorporating a carbonyl group at the ortho position relative to the quinone moiety was synthesized and analyzed by tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI/MS-MS), using Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) to dissociate the protonated species. Theoretical parameters such as molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), local Fukui functions and local Parr function for electrophilic attack as well as proton affinity (PA) and gas phase basicity (GB), were used to explain the preferred protonation sites. Transition states of some main fragmentation routes were obtained and the energies calculated at density functional theory (DFT) B3LYP level were compared with the obtained by ab initio quadratic configuration interaction with single and double excitation (QCISD). The results are in accordance with the observed distribution of ions. The nature of the substituents in the aromatic ring has a notable impact on the fragmentation routes of the molecules. 
27661438 | Alteration of the alertness-related network in patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy: A resting state fMRI study. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate alterations in the alertness-related network in patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy (rTLE) and explore the functional mechanisms of impaired alertness. METHODS: We recruited twenty patients with rTLE and eighteen matched healthy controls. All participants took a neuropsychological attention network test (ANT) and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning. We extracted the alertness-related network using multiple independent component analysis (MICA). Subsequently, we compared the intergroup differences in functional connectivity (FC) of this network. Then, the neuropsychological data were correlated to voxels that showed significant FC differences in patients and controls. RESULTS: The alertness-related network extracted from the patients was similar to that of the controls, covering the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle frontal gyrus, parietal lobe, part of the temporal lobe, and left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (p<0.05). Compared to controls, patients with rTLE exhibited decreased FC values in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and angular gyrus (p<0.05). Additionally, increased FC was shown in the right inferior frontal gyrus, Rolandic operculum, middle frontal gyrus, dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus, cuneus, and superior occipital gyrus (p<0.05). Behaviorally, patients with rTLE exhibited longer reaction times (RT) in the no cue (t=-2.07, p<0.05) and double cue (t=-2.28, p<0.05) conditions. However, the alertness effect in patients did not significantly differ from that of controls. Moreover, the alertness effect was negatively correlated with the mean Z-value in the right cuneus, which showed increased FC (r=-0.556, p=0.013) in patients with rTLE. There was no significant correlation in the control group. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that alterations in the alertness-related network may contribute to the alertness impairment exhibited by patients with rTLE. Our study may provide new insights into the mechanisms of alertness impairments in rTLE.
27774822 | Inhibitors of JAK-family kinases: an update on the patent literature 2013-2015, part 2. INTRODUCTION: Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of four enzymes; JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) that are critical in cytokine signalling and are strongly linked to both cancer and inflammatory diseases. There are currently two launched JAK inhibitors for the treatment of human conditions: tofacitinib for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ruxolitinib for myeloproliferative neoplasms including intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Areas covered: This review covers patents claiming activity against one or more JAK family members in the period 2013-2015 inclusive, and covers 95 patents from 42 applicants, split over two parts. The authors have ordered recent patents according to the primary applicant's name, with part 2 covering J through Z. Expert opinion: Inhibition of JAK-family kinases is an area of growing interest, catalysed by the maturity of data on marketed inhibitors ruxolitinib and tofacitinib in late stage clinical trials. Many applicants are pursuing traditional fast-follower strategies around these inhibitors, with a range of chemical strategies adopted. The challenge will be to show sufficient differentiation to the originator compounds, since dose limiting toxicities with such agents appear to be on target and mechanism-related and also considering that such agents may be available as generic compounds by the time follower agents reach market.
27788604 | Pirfenidone exerts a suppressive effect on CCL18 expression in U937-derived macrophages partly by inhibiting STAT6 phosphorylation. CONTEXT: CC chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) is suggested to play a role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Macrophages are thought to be the main source of CCL18, and the effect of pirfenidone, an anti-fibrotic agent for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, on the expression of CCL18 in macrophages warrants investigation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pirfenidone on the expression of CCL18 in macrophages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U937 cells were differentiated into macrophages by phorbol myristate acetate and then stimulated with recombinant IL-4 to induce the production of CCL18. The cells were treated with pirfenidone, and the mRNA and protein levels for CCL18 were measured by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The effects of pirfenidone on the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) expression and STAT6 activation were investigated and on the JAK kinase activity were measured using the Z'-LYTE  kinase assay. RESULTS: Pirfenidone significantly suppressed the expression of CCL18 when the cells were treated with concentrations of 50-250 mug/mL. Pirfenidone did not affect the expression of the IL-4R components. The selective STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 suppressed CCL18 expression. Both AS1517499 and pirfenidone suppressed STAT6 phosphorylation (p < .05), although the effect of pirfenidone was less marked than that of AS1517499. The Z'-LYTE  kinase assay showed a reduction in the activities of JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2 by pirfenidone. CONCLUSION: Pirfenidone suppresses CCL18 expression in macrophages and this effect is thought to be attributed partly to the inhibition of STAT6 phosphorylation.
28193636 | Evaluation of JAK3 Biology in Autoimmune Disease Using a Highly Selective, Irreversible JAK3 Inhibitor. Reversible janus associated kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as tofacitinib and decernotinib block cytokine signaling and are efficacious in treating autoimmune diseases. However, therapeutic doses are limited due to inhibition of other JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathways associated with hematopoiesis, lipid biogenesis, infection, and immune responses. A selective JAK3 inhibitor may have a better therapeutic index; however, until recently, no compounds have been described that maintain JAK3 selectivity in cells, as well as against the kinome, with good physicochemical properties to test the JAK3 hypothesis in vivo. To quantify the biochemical basis for JAK isozyme selectivity, we determined that the apparent Km value for each JAK isozyme ranged from 31.8 to 2.9 muM for JAK1 and JAK3, respectively. To confirm compound activity in cells, we developed a novel enzyme complementation assay that read activity of single JAK isozymes in a cellular context. Reversible JAK3 inhibitors cannot achieve sufficient selectivity against other isozymes in the cellular context due to inherent differences in enzyme ATP Km values. Therefore, we developed irreversible JAK3 compounds that are potent and highly selective in vitro in cells and against the kinome. Compound 2, a potent inhibitor of JAK3 (0.15 nM) was 4300-fold selective for JAK3 over JAK1 in enzyme assays, 67-fold [interleukin (IL)-2 versus IL-6] or 140-fold [IL-2 versus erythropoietin or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)] selective in cellular reporter assays and >35-fold selective in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell assays (IL-7 versus IL-6 or GMCSF). In vivo, selective JAK3 inhibition was sufficient to block the development of inflammation in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis, while sparing hematopoiesis.
29254929 | Inhibition of JAK-STAT Signaling Suppresses Pathogenic Immune Responses in Medium and Large Vessel Vasculitis. BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4+ T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1. METHODS: Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry). RESULTS: Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (<10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-gamma, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21. Tofacitinib disrupted adventitial microvascular angiogenesis, reduced outgrowth of hyperplastic intima, and minimized CD4+CD103+ tissue-resident memory T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine signaling dependent on JAK3 and JAK1 is critically important in chronic inflammation of medium and large arteries. The JAK inhibitor tofacitinib effectively suppresses tissue-resident memory T cells and inhibits core vasculitogenic effector pathways.
29549969 | Reliability of the classification of proximal femur fractures: Does clinical experience matter? BACKGROUND: Radiographic fracture classification helps with research on prognosis and treatment. AO/OTA classification into fracture type has shown to be reliable, but further classification of fractures into subgroups reduces the interobserver agreement and takes a considerable amount of practice and experience in order to master. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We assessed: (1) differences between more and less experienced trauma surgeons based on hip fractures treated per year, years of experience, and the percentage of their time dedicated to trauma, (2) differences in the interobserver agreement between classification into fracture type, group, and subgroup, and (3) differences in the interobserver agreement when assessing fracture stability compared to classifying fractures into type, group and subgroup. METHODS: This study used the Science of Variation Group to measure factors associated with variation in interobserver agreement on classification of proximal femur fractures according to the AO/OTA classification on radiographs. We selected 30 anteroposterior radiographs from 1061 patients aged 55 years or older with an isolated fracture of the proximal femur, with a spectrum of fracture types proportional to the full database. To measure the interobserver agreement the Fleiss' kappa was determined and bootstrapping (resamples = 1000) was used to calculate the standard error, z statistic, and 95% confidence intervals. We compared the Kappa values of surgeons with more experience to less experienced surgeons. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the Kappa values on each classification level (type, group, subgroup) between more and less experienced surgeons. When all surgeons were combined into one group, the interobserver reliability was the greatest for classifying the fractures into type (kappa, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97; p < 0.001), reflecting almost perfect agreement. When comparing the kappa values between classes (type, group, subgroup), we found statistically significant differences between each class. Substantial agreement was found in the clinically relevant groups stable/unstable trochanteric, displaced/non-displaced femoral neck, and femoral head fractures (kappa, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.67, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing body of evidence that relatively simple distinctions are more reliable and that this is independent of surgeon experience.
29666307 | Interleukin-2 shapes the cytotoxic T cell proteome and immune environment-sensing programs. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Janus kinases (JAKs) regulate transcriptional programs and protein synthesis to promote the differentiation of effector CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we generated an in-depth characterization of how IL-2 and JAKs configure the CTL proteome to control CTL function. We found that IL-2 signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 (JAK1/3) increased the abundance of a key subset of proteins to induce the accumulation of critical cytokines and effector molecules in T cells. Moreover, IL-2 maintained the concentration of proteins that support core metabolic processes essential for cellular fitness. One fundamental insight was the dominant role for IL-2 in stimulating effector T cells to detect microenvironmental cues. IL-2-JAK1/3 signaling pathways thus increased the abundance of nutrient transporters, nutrient sensors, and critical oxygen-sensing molecules. These data provide key insights into how IL-2 promotes T cell function and highlight signaling mechanisms and transcription factors that integrate oxygen sensing to transcriptional control of CD8+ T cell differentiation.
32076052 | The anti-inflammatory potential of cefazolin as common gamma chain cytokine inhibitor. A continuing quest for specific inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines brings promise for effective therapies designed for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Cefazolin, a safe, first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, has been recently shown to specifically interact with interleukin 15 (IL-15) receptor subunit alpha (IL-15Ralpha) and to inhibit IL-15-dependent TNF-alpha and IL-17 synthesis. The aim of this study was to elucidate cefazolin activity against IL-2, IL-4, IL-15 and IL-21, i.e. four cytokines sharing the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (gammac). In silico, molecular docking unveiled two potential cefazolin binding sites within the IL-2/IL-15Rbeta subunit and two within the gammac subunit. In vitro, cefazolin decreased proliferation of PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) following IL-2, IL-4 and IL-15 stimulation, reduced production of IFN-gamma, IL-17 and TNF-alpha in IL-2- and IL-15-treated PBMC and in IL-15 stimulated natural killer (NK) cells, attenuated IL-4-dependent expression of CD11c in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and suppressed phosphorylation of JAK3 in response to IL-2 and IL-15 in PBMC, to IL-4 in TF-1 (erythroleukemic cell line) and to IL-21 in NK-92 (NK cell line). The results of the study suggest that cefazolin may exert inhibitory activity against all of the gammac receptor-dependent cytokines, i.e. IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21.
32934304 | COVID-19 after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: report of two children. 
33040328 | Whole-exome sequencing of T- B+ severe combined immunodeficiency in Egyptian infants, JAK3 predominance and novel variants. Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is fatal if not treated with immune reconstitution. In Egypt, T- B+ SCID accounts for 38 5% of SCID diagnoses. An accurate genetic diagnosis is essential for choosing appropriate treatment modalities and for offering genetic counseling to the patient's family. The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical, immunological and molecular characteristics of a cohort of twenty Egyptian patients with T- B+ SCID. The initial diagnosis (based on clinical features and flow cytometry) was followed by molecular investigation (whole-exome sequencing). All patients had the classic clinical picture for SCID, including failure to thrive (n = 20), oral candidiasis (n = 17), persistent diarrhea (n = 14), pneumonia (n = 13), napkin dermatitis (n = 10), skin rash (n = 7), otitis media (n = 3) and meningitis (n = 2). The onset of manifestations was at the age of 2 4 +- 1 6 months and diagnosis at the age of 6 7 +-  5 months, giving a diagnostic delay of 4 3 months. JAK3 gene variants were most frequent (n = 12) with three novel variants identified, followed by IL2Rgamma variants (n = 6) with two novel variants. IL7Ralpha and CD3epsilon variants were found once, with a novel variant each. T- B+ NK- SCID accounted for approximately 90% of the Egyptian patients with T- B+ SCID. Of these T- B+ NK- SCID cases, 60% were autosomal recessive syndromes caused by JAK3 mutations and 30% were X-linked syndromes. It might be useful to sequence the JAK3 gene (i.e. targeted Sanger sequencing) in all T- B+ SCID patients, especially after X-linked SCID has been ruled out. Hence, no more than 10% of T- B+ SCID patients might require next-generation for a molecular diagnosis.
33492566 | Computational assessment of saikosaponins as adjuvant treatment for COVID-19: molecular docking, dynamics, and network pharmacology analysis. Saikosaponins are major biologically active triterpenoids, usually as glucosides, isolated from Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) such as Bupleurum spp., Heteromorpha spp., and Scrophularia scorodonia with their antiviral and immunomodulatory potential. This investigation presents molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and free energy calculation studies of saikosaponins as adjuvant therapy in the treatment for COVID19. Molecular docking studies for 23 saikosaponins on the crystal structures of the extracellular domains of human lnterleukin-6 receptor (IL6), human Janus Kinase-3 (JAK3), and dehydrogenase domain of Cylindrospermum stagnale NADPH-oxidase 5 (NOX5) were performed, and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-GBSA method. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that IL6 in complex with Saikosaponin_U and Saikosaponin_V, JAK3 in complex with Saikosaponin_B4 and Saikosaponin_I, and NOX5 in complex with Saikosaponin_BK1 and Saikosaponin_C have good docking and molecular dynamics profiles. However, the Janus Kinase-3 is the best interacting partner for the saikosaponin compounds. The network pharmacology analysis suggests saikosaponins interact with the proteins CAT Gene CAT (Catalase) and Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1); both of these enzymes play a major role in cell homeostasis and DNA damage during infection, suggesting a possible improvement in immune response toward COVID-19.
33542028 | Potent and Selective Knockdown of Tyrosine Kinase 2 by Antisense Oligonucleotides. Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the JAK family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, together with JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3. JAKs are important signaling mediators of many proinflammatory cytokines and represent compelling pharmacological targets for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Pan-acting small-molecule JAK inhibitors were approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. However, their limited selectivity among JAK members have led to undesirable side effects, driving a search toward specific JAK inhibitors. Recently, TYK2 has emerged as a target of choice for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19 with an optimum balance between efficacy and safety, based on observations from human genetics studies and clinical outcomes of several agents targeting cytokine pathways for which TYK2 plays an essential role. In this article, we address selective targeting of TYK2 from the genetic sequence space through development of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) against TYK2 mRNA. Potent ASO candidates were identified from the screening of over 200 ASOs using locked nucleic acid gapmer design. The lead ASOs exhibited potent and selective knockdown of TYK2 mRNA and protein across a panel of model human cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, showing no reduction in the mRNA and protein expression levels of other JAK paralogs. In agreement with the depletion of TYK2 proteins, several TYK2-mediated cytokine signaling pathways, including IFN-alpha and IL-12, were inhibited upon ASO treatment. Our results established the TYK2 ASOs as investigational tool compound and potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and severe COVID-19.
33717045 | Evidence for Involvement of the Salmonella enterica Z-Ring Assembly Factors ZapA and ZapB in Resistance to Bile. Genes annotated as ygfE and yiiU in the genome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encode proteins homologous to Escherichia coli cell division factors ZapA and ZapB, respectively. ZapA- and ZapB- mutants of S. enterica are bile-sensitive. The amount of zapB mRNA increases in the presence of a sublethal concentration of sodium deoxycholate (DOC) while zapA mRNA remains unaffected. Increased zapB mRNA level in the presence of DOC is not caused by upregulation of zapB transcription but by increased stability of zapB mRNA. This increase is suppressed by an hfq mutation, suggesting the involvement of a small regulatory RNA. We provide evidence that such sRNA is MicA. The ZapB protein is degraded in the presence of DOC, and degradation appears to involve the Lon protease. We propose that increased stability of zapB mRNA in the presence of DOC may counter degradation of bile-damaged ZapB, thereby providing sufficient level of functional ZapB protein to permit Z-ring assembly in the presence of bile.
33776915 | Type 1 Diabetes and Autoimmune Thyroid Disease-The Genetic Link. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) are the most frequent chronic autoimmune diseases worldwide. Several autoimmune endocrine and non-endocrine disorders tend to occur together. T1D and AITD often cluster in individuals and families, seen in the formation of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (AP). The close relationship between these two diseases is largely explained by sharing a common genetic background. The HLA antigens DQ2 (DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201) and DQ8 (DQA1*0301-DQB1*0302), tightly linked with DR3 and DR4, are the major common genetic predisposition. Moreover, functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (or rare variants) of various genes, such as the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte- associated antigen (CTLA4), the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), the interleukin-2 Receptor (IL2Ra), the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), and the tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF) that are involved in immune regulation have been identified to confer susceptibility to both T1D and AITD. Other genes including cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40), the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), the MHC Class I Polypeptide-Related Sequence A (MICA), insulin variable number of tandem repeats (INS-VNTR), the C-Type Lectin Domain Containing 16A (CLEC16A), the Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3 (ERBB3) gene, the interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (IFIH1), and various cytokine genes are also under suspicion to increase susceptibility to T1D and AITD. Further, BTB domain and CNC homolog 2 (BACH2), C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), SH2B adaptor protein 3 (SH2B3), and Rac family small GTPase 2 (RAC2) are found to be associated with T1D and AITD by various independent genome wide association studies and overlap in our list, indicating a strong common genetic link for T1D and AITD. As several susceptibility genes and environmental factors contribute to the disease aetiology of both T1D and AITD and/or AP subtype III variant (T1D+AITD) simultaneously, all patients with T1D should be screened for AITD, and vice versa.
34063488 | Scaling Concepts in Serpin Polymer Physics. alpha1-Antitrypsin is a protease inhibitor belonging to the serpin family. Serpin polymerisation is at the core of a class of genetic conformational diseases called serpinopathies. These polymers are known to be unbranched, flexible, and heterogeneous in size with a beads-on-a-string appearance viewed by negative stain electron microscopy. Here, we use atomic force microscopy and time-lapse dynamic light scattering to measure polymer size and shape for wild-type (M) and Glu342 Lys (Z) alpha1-antitrypsin, the most common variant that leads to severe pathological deficiency. Our data for small polymers deposited onto mica and in solution reveal a power law relation between the polymer size, namely the end-to-end distance or the hydrodynamic radius, and the polymer mass, proportional to the contour length. We use the scaling concepts of polymer physics to assess that alpha1-antitrypsin polymers are random linear chains with a low persistence length.
34173127 | SARS-CoV-2-Related Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Uncovers a Patient with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease. 
34210790 | A phase 2 multiple ascending dose study of the inhaled pan-JAK inhibitor nezulcitinib (TD-0903) in severe COVID-19. 
34315144 | Controllable epitaxial growth of GeSe2nanostructures and nonlinear optical properties. Germanium diselenide (GeSe2) has emerged as a new member of anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) materials and gained increasing attention because of its excellent air stability, wide band gap and unique anisotropic properties, which exhibits promising applications in the fields of electronics, optoelectronics and polarized photodetection. However, the controllable epitaxial growth of large-scale and high-quality GeSe2nanostructures to date remains a big challenge. Herein, GeSe2nanofilms with lateral size up to centimeter scale have been successfully prepared on mica substrate by employing chemical vapor deposition technique. Experimental results demonstrated that hydrogen is the key factor for the controllable growth of GeSe2nanostructures and GeSe2-based heterostructures. Corresponding growth mechanism was proposed based on systematical characterizations. The nonlinear optical properties of as-prepared GeSe2were investigated by employing open-aperture z-scan technique exhibiting significant saturable and reverse saturable absorption behaviors at wavelengths of 400 nm and 800 nm, respectively. This study provides a new and robust route for fabricating GeSe2nanostructures and 2D heterostructures, which will benefit the development of GeSe2-based nonlinear optical and optoelectronic devices.
35459733 | JAK inhibitors and COVID-19. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the innate immune response can be inhibited or delayed, and the subsequent persistent viral replication can induce emergency signals that may culminate in a cytokine storm contributing to the severe evolution of COVID-19. Cytokines are key regulators of the immune response and virus clearance, and, as such, are linked to the-possibly altered-response to the SARS-CoV-2. They act via a family of more than 40 transmembrane receptors that are coupled to one or several of the 4 Janus kinases (JAKs) coded by the human genome, namely JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. Once activated, JAKs act on pathways for either survival, proliferation, differentiation, immune regulation or, in the case of type I interferons, antiviral and antiproliferative effects. Studies of graft-versus-host and systemic rheumatic diseases indicated that JAK inhibitors (JAKi) exert immunosuppressive effects that are non-redundant with those of corticotherapy. Therefore, they hold the potential to cut-off pathological reactions in COVID-19. Significant clinical experience already exists with several JAKi in COVID-19, such as baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib, which were suggested by a meta-analysis (Patoulias et al.) to exert a benefit in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes when added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Yet, only baricitinib is recommended in first line for severe COVID-19 treatment by the WHO, as it is the only JAKi that has proven efficient to reduce mortality in individual randomized clinical trials (RCT), especially the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and COV-BARRIER phase 3 trials. As for secondary effects of JAKi treatment, the main caution with baricitinib consists in the induced immunosuppression as long-term side effects should not be an issue in patients treated for COVID-19.We discuss whether a class effect of JAKi may be emerging in COVID-19 treatment, although at the moment the convincing data are for baricitinib only. Given the key role of JAK1 in both type I IFN action and signaling by cytokines involved in pathogenic effects, establishing the precise timing of treatment will be very important in future trials, along with the control of viral replication by associating antiviral molecules.
35625811 | Radionuclide Imaging of Cytotoxic Immune Cell Responses to Anti-Cancer Immunotherapy. Cancer immunotherapy is an evolving and promising cancer treatment that takes advantage of the body's immune system to yield effective tumor elimination. Importantly, immunotherapy has changed the treatment landscape for many cancers, resulting in remarkable tumor responses and improvements in patient survival. However, despite impressive tumor effects and extended patient survival, only a small proportion of patients respond, and others can develop immune-related adverse events associated with these therapies, which are associated with considerable costs. Therefore, strategies to increase the proportion of patients gaining a benefit from these treatments and/or increasing the durability of immune-mediated tumor response are still urgently needed. Currently, measurement of blood or tissue biomarkers has demonstrated sampling limitations, due to intrinsic tumor heterogeneity and the latter being invasive. In addition, the unique response patterns of these therapies are not adequately captured by conventional imaging modalities. Consequently, non-invasive, sensitive, and quantitative molecular imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using specific radiotracers, have been increasingly used for longitudinal whole-body monitoring of immune responses. Immunotherapies rely on the effector function of CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells (NK) at tumor lesions; therefore, the monitoring of these cytotoxic immune cells is of value for therapy response assessment. Different immune cell targets have been investigated as surrogate markers of response to immunotherapy, which motivated the development of multiple imaging agents. In this review, the targets and radiotracers being investigated for monitoring the functional status of immune effector cells are summarized, and their use for imaging of immune-related responses are reviewed along their limitations and pitfalls, of which multiple have already been translated to the clinic. Finally, emerging effector immune cell imaging strategies and future directions are provided.
35731974 | Preclinical platforms to study therapeutic efficacy of human gammadelta T cells. BACKGROUND: Gamma delta (gammadelta) T lymphocytes are promising candidate for adoptive T cell therapy, however, their treatment efficacy is not satisfactory. Vdelta2 T cells are unique to primates and few suitable models are available to assay their anti-tumour function. METHODS: We tested human gammadelta T cell activation, tumour infiltration, and tumour-killing in four three-dimensional (3D) models, including unicellular, bicellular and multicellular melanoma spheroids, and patient-derived melanoma organoids. We studied the effects of checkpoint inhibitors on gammadelta T cells and performed a small molecule screen using these platforms. RESULTS: gammadelta T cells rapidly responded to melanoma cells and infiltrated melanoma spheroids better than alphabeta T cells in PBMCs. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in bicellular spheroids, stroma cells in multicellular melanoma spheroids and inhibitory immune cells in organoids significantly inhibited immune cell infiltrates including gammadelta T cells and lessened their cytotoxicity to tumour cells. Tumour-infiltrating gammadelta T cells showed exhausted immunophenotypes with high checkpoints expression (CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD-L1). Immune checkpoint inhibitors increased gammadelta T cell infiltration of 3D models and killing of melanoma cells in all four 3D models. Our small molecule screen assay and subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that epigenetic modifiers enhanced the chemotaxis and cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells through upregulating MICA/B, inhibiting HDAC6/7 pathway and downregulating the levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2 in CAFs and tumour cells. These compounds increased CXCR4 and CD107a expression, IFN-gamma production and decreased PD-1 expression of gammadelta T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour-infiltrating gammadelta T cells show exhausted immunophenotypes and limited anti-tumour capacity in melanoma 3D models. Checkpoint inhibitors and epigenetic modifiers enhance anti-tumour functions of gammadelta T cells. These four 3D models provided valuable preclinical platforms to test gammadelta T cell functions for immunotherapy.
36097295 | Selective inhibitors of JAK1 targeting an isoform-restricted allosteric cysteine. The Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases includes four isoforms (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) and is responsible for signal transduction downstream of diverse cytokine receptors. JAK inhibitors have emerged as important therapies for immun(onc)ological disorders, but their use is limited by undesirable side effects presumed to arise from poor isoform selectivity, a common challenge for inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket of kinases. Here we describe the chemical proteomic discovery of a druggable allosteric cysteine present in the non-catalytic pseudokinase domain of JAK1 (C817) and TYK2 (C838), but absent from JAK2 or JAK3. Electrophilic compounds selectively engaging this site block JAK1-dependent trans-phosphorylation and cytokine signaling, while appearing to act largely as 'silent' ligands for TYK2. Importantly, the allosteric JAK1 inhibitors do not impair JAK2-dependent cytokine signaling and are inactive in cells expressing a C817A JAK1 mutant. Our findings thus reveal an allosteric approach for inhibiting JAK1 with unprecedented isoform selectivity.
36227341 | alphaVEGFR2-MICA fusion antibodies enhance immunotherapy effect and synergize with PD-1 blockade. Antiangiogenic therapy has shown significant clinical benefits in gastric cancer (GC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their effectiveness is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The MHC class I chain-related molecules A and B (MICA/B) are expressed in many human cancers, enabling elimination of cancer cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes through natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) receptor activation. To improve antiangiogenic therapy and prolong its efficacy, we generated a bi-specific fusion protein (mAb04-MICA). This was comprised of an antibody targeting VEGFR2 fused to a MICA alpha1-alpha2 ectodomain. mAb04-MICA inhibited proliferation of GC and NSCLC cells through specific binding to VEGFR2 and had superior anti-tumor efficacy in both GC and NSCLC-bearing mouse models compared with ramucirumab. Further investigation revealed that the mAb04-MICA promoted NKG2D+ NK cell activation and induced the tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization from M2 type to M1 type both in vitro and in vivo. The polarization of TAMs upon NKG2D and MICA mediated activation has not yet been reported. Moreover, given the up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumors during anti-angiogenesis therapy, anti-PD-1 antibody enhanced the anti-tumoral activity of mAb04-MICA through stimulating infiltration and activation of NKs and CD8+T cells in responding tumors. Our findings demonstrate that dual targeting of angiogenesis and NKG2D, or in combination with the PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, is a promising anti-tumor therapeutic strategy. This is accomplished through maintaining or reinstating tumor immunosurveillance during treatment, which expands the repertoire of anti-angiogenesis-based cancer immunotherapies.
36446137 | Designing Cancer Immunotherapies That Engage T Cells and NK Cells. T cells and natural killer (NK) cells have complementary roles in tumor immunity, and dual T cell and NK cell attack thus offers opportunities to deepen the impact of immunotherapy. Recent work has also shown that NK cells play an important role in recruiting dendritic cells to tumors and thus enhance induction of CD8 T cell responses, while IL-2 secreted by T cells activates NK cells. Targeting of immune evasion mechanisms from the activating NKG2D receptor and its MICA and MICB ligands on tumor cells offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly, T cells and NK cells share several important inhibitory and activating receptors that can be targeted to enhance T cell- and NK cell-mediated immunity. These inhibitory receptor-ligand systems include CD161-CLEC2D, TIGIT-CD155, and NKG2A/CD94-HLA-E. We also discuss emerging therapeutic strategies based on inhibitory and activating cytokines that profoundly impact the function of both lymphocyte populations within tumors. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Immunology, Volume 41 is April 2023. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
36590594 | IL-15 induced bystander activation of CD8+ T cells may mediate endothelium injury through NKG2D in Hantaan virus infection. Introduction: Hantaan virus (HTNV) can cause endothelium injury in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) patients. Bystander activation of CD8+ T cells by virus infection has been shown that was involved in host injury, but it is unclear during HTNV infection. This project aimed to study the effect of bystander-activated CD8+ T cell responses in HTNV infection. Methods: The in vitro infection model was established to imitate the injury of endothelium in HFRS patients. Flow cytometry was performed to detect the expression of markers of tetramer+ CD8+ T cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The levels of interleukin-15 (IL-15) in serum and supermanant were detected using ELISA kit. The expression of MICA of HUVECs was respectively determined by flow cytometry and western blot. The cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells was assessed through the cytotoxicity assay and antibody blocking assay. Results: EBV or CMV-specific CD8+ T cells were bystander activated after HTNV infection in HFRS patients. HTNV-infected HUVECs in vitro could produce high levels of IL-15, which was positively correlated with disease severity and the expression of NKG2D on bystander-activated CD8+ T cells. Moreover, the elevated IL-15 could induce activation of CD122 (IL-15Rbeta)+NKG2D+ EBV/CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. The expression of IL-15Ralpha and ligand for NKG2D were upregulated on HTNV-infected HUVECs. Bystander-activated CD8+ T cells could exert cytotoxicity effects against HTNV-infected HUVECs, which could be enhanced by IL-15 stimulation and blocked by NKG2D antibody. Discussion: IL-15 induced bystander activation of CD8+ T cells through NKG2D, which may mediate endothelium injury during HTNV infection in HFRS patients.
36765808 | Inhibition of Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1) Upregulates Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1) to Promote Apoptosis and Activate Anti-Tumor Immunity via MICA in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). BACKGROUND: CHK1 is considered a key cell cycle checkpoint kinase in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway to communicate with several signaling pathways involved in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in numerous cancers. However, the mechanism of CHK1 signaling regulating TME in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. METHODS: CHK1 expression in HCC tissue was determined by IHC staining assay. DNA damage and apoptosis in HCC cells induced by cisplatin or CHK1 inhibition were detected by WB and flow cytometry. The interaction of CHK1 and IRF1 was analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequence, WB, and immunoprecipitation assay. The mechanism of IRF1 regulating MICA was investigated by ChIP-qPCR. RESULTS: CHK1 expression is upregulated in human HCC tumors compared to the background liver. High CHK1 mRNA level predicts advanced tumor stage and worse prognosis. Cisplatin and CHK1 inhibition augment cellular DNA damage and apoptosis. Overexpressed CHK1 suppresses IRF1 expression through proteolysis. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-sequence analyses confirmed that MICA expression positively correlated with IRF1 in HCC cells. Immunoprecipitation assay showed the binding between CHK1 and IRF1. Cisplatin and CHK1 inhibition upregulate MICA expression through IRF1-mediated transcriptional effects. A novel specific cis-acting IRF response element was identified at -1756 bp in the MICA promoter region that bound IRF1 to induce MICA gene transcription. MICA may increase NK cell and CD8+T cell infiltration in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: DNA damage regulates the interaction of CHK1 and IRF1 to activate anti-tumor immunity via the IRF1-MICA pathway in HCC.
36860910 | Comprehensive Immunoprofiling of High-Risk Oral Proliferative and Localized Leukoplakia. Oral leukoplakia is common and may, in some cases, progress to carcinoma. Proliferative leukoplakia is a progressive, often multifocal subtype with a high rate of malignant transformation compared with the more common localized leukoplakia. We hypothesized that the immune microenvironment and gene expression patterns would be distinct for proliferative leukoplakia compared with localized leukoplakia. We summarize key clinicopathologic features among proliferative leukoplakia and localized leukoplakia and compare cancer-free survival (CFS) between subgroups. We analyze immunologic gene expression profiling in proliferative leukoplakia and localized leukoplakia tissue samples (NanoString PanCancer Immune Oncology Profiling). We integrate immune cell activation and spatial distribution patterns in tissue samples using multiplexed immunofluorescence and digital image capture to further define proliferative leukoplakia and localized leukoplakia. Among N = 58 patients (proliferative leukoplakia, n = 29; localized leukoplakia, n = 29), only the clinical diagnosis of proliferative leukoplakia was associated with significantly decreased CFS (HR, 11.25; P < 0.01; 5-year CFS 46.8% and 83.6% among patients with proliferative leukoplakia and localized leukoplakia, respectively). CD8+ T cells and T regulatory (Treg) were more abundant among proliferative leukoplakia samples (P < 0.01) regardless of degree of epithelial dysplasia, and often colocalized to the dysplasia-stromal interface. Gene set analysis identified granzyme M as the most differentially expressed gene favoring the proliferative leukoplakia subgroup (log2 fold change, 1.93; P adj < 0.001). Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was comparatively overexpressed among proliferative leukoplakia samples, with higher (>5) PD-L1 scores predicting worse CFS (P adj < 0.01). Proliferative leukoplakia predicts a high rate of malignant transformation within 5 years of diagnosis. A prominent CD8+ T-cell and Treg signature along with relative PD-L1 overexpression compared with localized leukoplakia provides strong rationale for PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade using preventative immunotherapy. Significance: This is the first in-depth profiling effort to immunologically characterize high-risk proliferative leukoplakia as compared with the more common localized leukoplakia. We observed a notable cytotoxic T-cell and Treg signature with relative overexpression of PD-L1 in high-risk proliferative leukoplakia providing a strong preclinical rationale for investigating PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade in this disease as preventative immunotherapy.
36907052 | MALAT-1: Immunomodulatory lncRNA hampering the innate and the adaptive immune arms in triple negative breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is known as hot immunogenic tumor. Yet, it is one of the most aggressive BC subtypes. TNBC evolve several tactics to evade the immune surveillance phenomena, one of which is shedding of natural killer (NK) cells activating immune ligands such as MICA/B and/or by inducing the expression of the immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 and B7-H4. MALAT-1 is an oncogenic lncRNA. MALAT-1 immunogenic profile is not well investigated. AIM: The study aims at exploring the immunogenic role of MALAT-1 in TNBC patients and cell lines and to identify its molecular mechanism in altering both innate and adaptive immune cells present at the tumor microenvironment of TNBC METHODS: BC patients (n = 35) were recruited. Primary NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes were isolated from normal individuals using the negative selection method. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured and transfected by several oligonucleotides by lipofection technique. Screening of ncRNAs was performed using q-RT-PCR. Immunological functional analysis experiments were performed upon co-culturing primary natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes using LDH assay. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify potential microRNAs targeted by MALAT-1. RESULTS: MALAT-1 expression was significantly upregulated in BC patinets with a profound expression in TNBC patients compared to their normal counterparts. Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between MALAT-1, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Knocking down of MALAT-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a significant induction of MICA/B, repression of PD-L1 and B7-H4 expression levels. Enhancement of cytotoxic activity of co-cultured NK and CD8+ cells with MALAT-1 siRNAs transfected MDA-MB-231 cells. In silico analysis revealed that miR-34a and miR-17-5p are potential targets to MALAT-1; accordingly, they were found to be downregulated in BC patients. Forcing the expression of miR-34a in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a significant induction in MICA/B levels. Ectopic expression of miR-17-5p in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly repressed the expression of PD-L1 and B7-H4 checkpoints. Validations of MALAT-1/miR-34a\ and \MALAT-1/miR-17-5p axes were performed by a series of co-transfections and functional assessment of cytotoxic profile of primary immune cells. CONCLUSION: This study proposes a novel epigenetic alteration exerted by TNBC cells mainly by inducing the expression of MALAT-1 lncRNA. MALAT-1 mediates innate and adaptive immune suppression events partially via targeting miR-34a/MICA/B and miR-175p/PD-L1/B7-H4 axes in TNBC patients and cell lines.
37190149 | Tumor-Infiltrating CD45RO+ Memory Cells Are Associated with Favorable Prognosis in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients. BACKGROUND: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have been used to predict the prognosis of solid tumors. In this study, we investigated which molecules in TILs play a role in the prognosis of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: In a retrospective case-control study, we immunohistochemically evaluated the expression of CD3, CD8, CD45RO, Granzyme B, and the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A (MICA) of the histocompatibility complex as predictors of prognosis in 33 patients with OSCC. The patients were classified as TILsHigh or TILsLow according to the number of TILs for each molecule in the central tumor (CT) and invasive margin (IM). Furthermore, MICA expression scores were determined based on the intensity of the staining. RESULTS: CD45RO+/TIL in the nonrecurrent group were significantly higher than those in the recurrent group in the CT and IM areas (p < 0.05). The disease-free survival/overall survival rate of the CD45RO+/TILsLow group in the CT and IM areas and the Granzyme B+/TILsLow group in the IM area was significantly lower than that of the CD45RO+/TILsHigh group and the Granzyme B+/TILsHigh group, respectively (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the MICA expression score of tumors around the CD45RO+/TILsHigh group was significantly higher than that of the CD45RO+/TILsLow group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A high ratio of CD45RO-expressing TILs was associated with a disease-free/overall survival improvement in OSCC patients. Furthermore, the number of TILs that express CD45RO was associated with the expression of MICA in tumors. These results suggest that CD45RO-expressing TILs are useful biomarkers for OSCC.
38263353 | Integrated Safety Analysis of Ritlecitinib, an Oral JAK3/TEC Family Kinase Inhibitor, for the Treatment of Alopecia Areata from the ALLEGRO Clinical Trial Program. BACKGROUND: The ALLEGRO phase 2a and 2b/3 studies demonstrated that ritlecitinib, an oral JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor, is efficacious at doses of >= 30 mg in patients aged >= 12 years with alopecia areata (AA). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of ritlecitinib in an integrated analysis of four studies in AA. METHODS: Two cohorts were analyzed: a placebo-controlled and an all-exposure cohort. Proportions and study size-adjusted incidence rates (IRs) of adverse events (AEs) of interest and laboratory abnormalities are reported. RESULTS: In the placebo-controlled cohort (n = 881; median exposure: 169 days), the proportion of ritlecitinib-treated patients with AEs was 70.2-75.4% across doses versus 69.5% in the placebo group; serious AEs occurred in 0-3.2% versus 1.9% for the placebo. A total of 19 patients permanently discontinued due to AEs (5 while receiving the placebo). In the all-exposure cohort (n = 1294), median ritlecitinib exposure was 624 days [2091.7 total patient-years (PY)]. AEs were reported in 1094 patients (84.5%) and serious AEs in 57 (4.4%); 78 (6.0%) permanently discontinued due to AEs. The most common AEs were headache (17.7%; 11.9/100 PY), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test (15.5%; 9.8/100 PY), and nasopharyngitis (12.4%; 8.2/100 PY). There were two deaths (breast cancer and acute respiratory failure/cardiorespiratory arrest). Proportions (IRs) were < 0.1% (0.05/100 PY) for opportunistic infections, 1.5% (0.9/100 PY) for herpes zoster, 0.5% (0.3/100 PY) for malignancies (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and 0.2% (0.1/100 PY) for major adverse cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: Ritlecitinib is well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile up to 24 months in patients aged >= 12 years with AA (video abstract and graphical plain language summary available). TRIAL REGISTRIES: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02974868 (date of registration: 11/29/2016), NCT04517864 (08/18/2020), NCT03732807 (11/07/2018), and NCT04006457 (07/05/2019).
38505971 | Rapid triage and transfer system for patients with proven Covid-19 at emergency department. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a viral disease notorious for frequent worldwide outbreaks. It is difficult to control, thereby resulting in overload of the healthcare system. A possible solution to prevent overcrowding is rapid triage of patients, which makes it possible to focus care on the high-risk patients and minimize the impact of crowding on patient prognosis. METHODS: The triage algorithm assessed self-sufficiency, oximetry, systolic blood pressure, and the Glasgow coma scale. Compliance with the triage protocol was defined as fulfillment of all protocol steps, including assignment of the correct level of care. Triage was considered successful if there was no change in the scope of care (e.g., unscheduled hospital admission, transfer to different level of care) or if there was unexpected death within 48 hours. RESULTS: A total of 929 patients were enrolled in the study. Triage criteria were fulfilled in 825 (88.8%) patients. Within 48 hours, unscheduled hospital admission, transfer to different level of care, or unexpected death occurred in 56 (6.0%), 6 (0.6%), and 5 (0.5%) patients, respectively. The risk of unscheduled hospital admission or transfer to different level of care was significantly increased if triage criteria were not fulfilled [13.1% vs. 76.1%, RR 5.8 (3.8-8.3), p < 0.001; 0.5% vs. 5.2%, RR 11.4 (2.3-57.7), p = 0.036, respectively]. CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithm for triage of patients with proven COVID-19 is a simple, fast, and reliable tool for rapid sorting for outpatient treatment, hospitalization on a standard ward, or assignment to an intensive care unit.
38511389 | Impact of donor NKG2D and MICA gene polymorphism on clinical outcomes of adult and paediatric allogeneic cord blood transplantation for malignant diseases. OBJECTIVES: NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed by natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells and activation intensity varies by NKG2D expression level or nature of its ligand. An NKG2D gene polymorphism determines high (HNK1) or low (LNK1) expression. MICA is the most polymorphic NKG2D ligand and stronger effector cell activation associates with methionine rather than valine at residue 129. We investigated correlation between cord blood (CB) NKG2D and MICA genotypes and haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant outcome. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 267 CB HSC recipients (178 adult and 87 paediatric) who underwent transplant for malignant disease between 2007 and 2018, analysing CB graft DNA for NKG2D and MICA polymorphisms using Sanger sequencing. Multivariate analysis was used to correlate these results with transplant outcomes. RESULTS: In adult patients, LNK1 homozygous CB significantly improved 60-day neutrophil engraftment (hazard ratio (HR) 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4-0.9; p = .003). In paediatrics, HNK1 homozygous CB improved 60-day engraftment (HR 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.7; p = .003), as did MICA-129 methionine+ CB grafts (HR 1.7 95% CI 1.1-2.6; p = .02). CONCLUSION: CB NKG2D and MICA genotypes potentially improve CB HSC engraftment. However, results contrast between adult and paediatric recipients and may reflect transplant procedure disparities between cohorts.
38536662 | Natural killer group 2D-major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A activation enhances natural killer cell-mediated immunity against hepatocellular carcinoma: A review. The recent clinical introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has improved therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. However, these therapies targeting CD8+ T lymphocytes have a response rate of approximately 30%. In addition to CD8+ T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells represent promising therapeutic targets for hepatocellular carcinoma, because they comprise 30%-50% of all lymphocytes in the liver and contribute to antitumor immunity. A recent meta-analysis revealed that the percentage of infiltrating NK cells in hepatocellular carcinoma correlates with a better patient outcome. Similarly, our previous genome-wide association study on chronic viral hepatitis showed that a single-nucleotide polymorphism of major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), a ligand to the NK activating receptor, plays a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms underlying the regulation of MICA and NK group 2D expression in chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, we describe recent reports on MICA single-nucleotide polymorphism-driven hepatocarcinogenesis. The suppression of MICA shedding could represent a promising approach for immunosurveillance, as increased expression of membrane-bound MICA achieved through the use of a MICA shedding inhibitor also enhances NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
38598033 | Omenn Syndrome in Two Infants with Different Hypomorphic Variants in Janus Kinase 3. Biallelic null or hypomorphic variants in JAK3 cause SCID and less frequently Omenn syndrome. We investigated homozygous hypomorphic JAK3 mutations in two patients, and expression and function of a novel JAK3R431P variant in Omenn syndrome. Immunophenotyping of PBMC from the patient with the novel JAK3R431P variant was undertaken, by flow cytometry and Phosflow after stimulation with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. JAK3 expression was investigated by Western blotting. We report two patients with homozygous hypomorphic JAK3 variants and clinical features of Omenn syndrome. One patient had a previously described JAK3R775H variant, and the second had a novel JAK3R431P variant. One patient with a novel JAK3R431P variant had normal expression of JAK3 in immortalised EBV-LCL cells but reduced phosphorylation of STAT5 after stimulation with IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 consistent with impaired kinase activity. These results suggest the JAK3R431P variant to be hypomorphic. Both patients are alive and well after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. They have full donor chimerism, restitution of thymopoiesis and development of appropriate antibody responses following vaccination. We expand the phenotype of hypomorphic JAK3 deficiency and demonstrate the importance of functional testing of novel variants in disease-causing genes.
22342247 | Synergistic effect of two combinations of antituberculous drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Fluoroquinolones such as ofloxacin are promising drugs to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and have been proposed for shortening the treatment of TB. The objectives were to study the synergistic effect of the combinations of three drugs and to evaluate the in vitro interactions of the following combinations against Mycobacterium tuberculosis: A) isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol and B) ofloxacin, rifampicin, and ethambutol using an adaptation of the two-dimensional chequerboard assay. A total of 12 isolates resistant to isoniazid or to isoniazid-streptomycin and 11 drug-susceptible isolates were tested. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FICI) was calculated as follows: FICI = FIC(A) + FICB + FIC(C) = A/MIC(A) + B/MIC(B) + C/MIC(C) where A, B and C were the MICs of each antibiotic in combination and MIC(A), MIC(B) and MIC(C) were the individual MICs. The FICI was interpreted as synergism when the value was <=0.75. In combination A, 11 drug-susceptible isolates decreased the individual MIC one to three dilutions, showing indifferent activity in 81.8% (FICI = 0.88-1.6) and synergistic activity in 18.1% (FICI = 0.6). In combination B, 21 out of the 23 isolates studied (91.3%) showed synergism (FICI = 0.31-0.62). In conclusion, adaptation of the two-dimensional chequerboard assay is a reliable method to study in vitro three-drug combinations. Both three-drug combinations tested may be useful against drug-resistant isolates, although the combination including ofloxacin showed better efficacy, being of potential use in drug-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant isolates.
22880104 | Effective elicitation of human effector CD8+ T Cells in HLA-B*51:01 transgenic humanized mice after infection with HIV-1. Humanized mice are expected to be useful as small animal models for in vivo studies on the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. However, it is well known that human CD8(+) T cells cannot differentiate into effector cells in immunodeficient mice transplanted with only human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), because human T cells are not educated by HLA in the mouse thymus. We here established HLA-B*51:01 transgenic humanized mice by transplanting human CD34(+) HSCs into HLA-B*51:01 transgenic NOD/SCID/Jak3(-/-) mice (hNOK/B51Tg mice) and investigated whether human effector CD8(+) T cells would be elicited in the mice or in those infected with HIV-1 NL4-3. There were no differences in the frequency of late effector memory and effector subsets (CD27(low)CD28(-)CD45RA(+/-)CCR7(-) and CD27(-)CD28(-)CD45RA(+/-)CCR7(-), respectively) among human CD8(+) T cells and in that of human CD8(+) T cells expressing CX3CR1 and/or CXCR1 between hNOK/B51Tg and hNOK mice. In contrast, the frequency of late effector memory and effector CD8(+) T cell subsets and of those expressing CX3CR1 and/or CXCR1 was significantly higher in HIV-1-infected hNOK/B51Tg mice than in uninfected ones, whereas there was no difference in that of these subsets between HIV-1-infected and uninfected hNOK mice. These results suggest that hNOK/B51Tg mice had CD8(+) T cells that were capable of differentiating into effector T cells after viral antigen stimulation and had a greater ability to elicit effector CD8(+) T cells than hNOK ones.
23312604 | In vitro effect of three-drug combinations of antituberculous agents against multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Multidrug resistance has become a problem in the management of tuberculosis, leading to an urgent need for research related to new regimens including the currently available drugs. The objectives of this study were: (i) to study the effect of the following second-choice three-drug combinations against multidrug-resistant (MDR) and drug-susceptible clinical isolates (levofloxacin, linezolid and ethambutol; levofloxacin, amikacin and ethambutol; and levofloxacin, linezolid and amikacin); and (ii) to compare the effect of these combinations with an isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol combination against drug-susceptible clinical isolates. A total of 9 MDR clinical and 12 drug-susceptible isolates (11 clinical isolates and the H37Rv reference strain) were studied using an adaptation of the chequerboard assay. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated as follows: FICI=FIC(A)+FIC(B)+FIC(C)=A/MIC(A)+B/MIC(B)+C/MIC(C), where A, B and C are the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of each antibiotic in combination and MIC(A), MIC(B) and MIC(C) are the individual MICs. The FICI was interpreted as synergism when the value was <0.75. The FICI of all the combinations ranged from 1.5 to 3, showing indifferent activity. No differences were found between MDR and drug-susceptible isolates, or between the second-choice combinations and the fourth combination against drug-susceptible isolates. In conclusion, the second-choice drugs are equally effective as the combination of isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol.
26458453 | [Basic understanding of the HLA system in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation]. Human immune responses are principally characterized by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, a diverse set of cell surface molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex gene cluster on the short arm of chromosome 6. Among various members of the HLA family, the best characterized are the classic highly polymorphic class I and class II molecules that are responsible for antigen presentation to T cells and regulation of NK cell functions. In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, sophisticated approaches to donor-recipient allele-level matching at 3 class I (HLA-A/B/C) and 3 class II (HLA-DRB1/DQB1/DPB1) loci have been proven to lower the risk of immunologic complications such as graft failure and graft-versus-host disease, and possibly to confer effective graft-versus-malignancy effects. Future areas of research include clarifying the role of relatively non-polymorphic non-classical HLA molecules (HLA-E/F/G, HLA-DM/DO) and polymorphic/non-polymorphic class I-related molecules (MICA, MICB, HFE, MR1, CD1, FcRn) in the immune regulation that follows hematopoietic cell transplantation. 
27273902 | Characterization of a novel MICA allele, MICA*012:05, by cloning and sequencing. A new MICA allelic variant, MICA*012:05, has been identified in a Chinese Mongolian population. Following polymerase chain reaction-sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT), this new allele was further confirmed by cloning and sequencing. MICA*012:05 was linked to an HLA-A*24-C*01-B*55:02-DRB1*09 haplotype. MICA*012:05 differs from MICA*012:01 by a single synonymous C to T substitution at nucleotide position 269 in exon 3. 
27549307 | Matching for the nonconventional MHC-I MICA gene significantly reduces the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is among the most challenging complications in unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The highly polymorphic MHC class I chain-related gene A, MICA, encodes a stress-induced glycoprotein expressed primarily on epithelia. MICA interacts with the invariant activating receptor NKG2D, expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes, and is located in the MHC, next to HLA-B Hence, MICA has the requisite attributes of a bona fide transplantation antigen. Using high-resolution sequence-based genotyping of MICA, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical effect of MICA mismatches in a multicenter cohort of 922 unrelated donor HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1 10/10 allele-matched HCT pairs. Among the 922 pairs, 113 (12.3%) were mismatched in MICA MICA mismatches were significantly associated with an increased incidence of grade III-IV acute GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50-2.23; P < .001), chronic GVHD (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.45-1.55; P < .001), and nonelapse mortality (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.24-1.46; P < .001). The increased risk for GVHD was mirrored by a lower risk for relapse (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.43-0.59; P < .001), indicating a possible graft-versus-leukemia effect. In conclusion, when possible, selecting a MICA-matched donor significantly influences key clinical outcomes of HCT in which a marked reduction of GVHD is paramount. The tight linkage disequilibrium between MICA and HLA-B renders identifying a MICA-matched donor readily feasible in clinical practice.
27840957 | Upregulation of CD54 and downregulation of HLA-ABC contribute to the novel enhancement of the susceptibility of HL-60 cells to NK cell-mediated cytolysis induced by ATRA plus VPA. Enhancement of the susceptibility of HL-60 cells to NK cell-mediated cytolysis induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) plus valproate (VPA) was evaluated. In addition to the synergistic effect of ATRA plus VPA on HL-60 cells, the optimal concentration of 1 mM VPA plus 0.5 microM ATRA increased the cytotoxic sensitivity of HL-60 cells to NK cells. The expression of the activated receptors NKp30 and NKG2D on NK-92 cells was higher compared with the levels noted for the other receptors, and the expression of NKG2D ligands MICA/B on HL-60 cells was not significantly upregulated in the ATRA plus VPA goup compared with the control. Moreover, it was observed that the ligands of NKp30 on HL-60 cells presented the same variation trend. As to the co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules on NK-92 and their ligands on HL-60 cells post exposure to ATRA and VPA alone or their combination, there was no obvious change in the expression of CD112, CD48 and CD70 on the HL-60 cells. However, the expression of CD54 on HL-60 cells was significantly upregulated. In contrast, the expression of NKG2A ligands HLA-ABC on HL-60 cells was obviously downregulated. In addition, the expression of HLA-E on the HL-60 cells in the group treated with ATRA plus VPA was not significantly increased. In conclusion, the combination of VPA and ATRA not only induced the differentiation of HL-60 cells, but also induced enhancement of the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to NK cells by downregulating the expression of HLA-ABC and upregulating the expression of CD54, but not MICA/MICB. The results provide experimental and theoretical basis for the clinical combination of a low-dose of ATRA plus VPA for the treatment of leukemia.
27870115 | MICA Gene Deletion in 3411 DNA Samples from Five Distinct Populations in Mainland China and Lack of Association with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) in a Southern Chinese Han population. Deletion of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related genes A (MICA*Del) was investigated in 3,411 DNA samples from two southern Chinese Han populations (Hunan Han, HNH; Guangdong Han, GDH), two northern Chinese populations (Inner Mongolia Han, IMH; Inner Mongolia Mongol, IMM) and one southeastern Chinese Han population (Fujian Han, FJH) using an in-house polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific priming (PCR-SSP) assay, which enables direct discrimination between heterozygote and homozygote for MICA*Del. MICA*Del showed a frequency ranging from 0.8% in FJH to 5.7% in IMM (Pcorrected < 0.05), indicating northward increase in frequency of MICA*Del in Chinese populations. In contrast to the association reported recently in a Taiwan Chinese population and a Malaysian Chinese cohort, MICA*Del distribution did not differ between 1,120 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1,483 normal controls in the HNH population (1.03% in NPC cases vs 1.18% in the controls, OR (95% CI) = 0.87 (0.51-1.47), p = 0.69). Further gender-stratified analysis also failed to disclose any male-specific association reported in a Taiwan Chinese population. Multi-locus typing of the 94 samples carrying MICA*Del revealed two new haplotypes, HLA-A*11:01-B*13:01-MICA*Del-MICB*009N-DRB1*04:06 and HLA-B*35:01-MICA*Del-MICB*009N-DRB1*15:01, in addition to HLA-B*48-MICA*Del. Unexpectedly, two samples with MICA*Del in the HNH population were each consistently found to have two distinct MICA alleles, indicating the existence of two MICA gene copies on certain HLA haplotypes. Based on the results from a sizeable case-control study, our data suggest that there is no association between MICA*Del and NPC in the southern Chinese Han population.
28085157 | Temperature is a key factor in Micromonas-virus interactions. The genus Micromonas comprises phytoplankton that show among the widest latitudinal distributions on Earth, and members of this genus are recurrently infected by prasinoviruses in contrasted thermal ecosystems. In this study, we assessed how temperature influences the interplay between the main genetic clades of this prominent microalga and their viruses. The growth of three Micromonas strains (Mic-A, Mic-B, Mic-C) and the stability of their respective lytic viruses (MicV-A, MicV-B, MicV-C) were measured over a thermal range of 4-32.5  C. Similar growth temperature optima (Topt) were predicted for all three hosts but Mic-B exhibited a broader thermal tolerance than Mic-A and Mic-C, suggesting distinct thermoacclimation strategies. Similarly, the MicV-C virus displayed a remarkable thermal stability compared with MicV-A and MicV-B. Despite these divergences, infection dynamics showed that temperatures below Topt lengthened lytic cycle kinetics and reduced viral yield and, notably, that infection at temperatures above Topt did not usually result in cell lysis. Two mechanisms operated depending on the temperature and the biological system. Hosts either prevented the production of viral progeny or maintained their ability to produce virions with no apparent cell lysis, pointing to a possible switch in the viral life strategy. Hence, temperature changes critically affect the outcome of Micromonas infection and have implications for ocean biogeochemistry and evolution.
29850626 | Role of Anti-MICA Antibodies in Graft Survival of Renal Transplant Recipients of India. INTRODUCTION: The MIC (MHC class I chain-related) genes are a group of nonclassical MHC genes, located in the MHC class 1 region of chromosome 6. The aim of the present study was to find the prevalence of MHC class 1 chain-related (MICA) alloantibodies in patients undergoing live-related donor renal transplantation and its role in short-term graft survival. The role of blood transfusion in the formation of these antibodies was also studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pretransplant samples of patients undergoing renal allograft transplantation were tested for anti-MICA antibodies. Association of various demographics, HLA-A + B + DRB1 mismatches, anti-HLA antibody screen, and anti-MICA antibodies was assessed using Pearson's chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of 646 serum samples, 94 (14.6%) were positive and 552 (85.4%) were negative for anti-MICA antibodies. Patients with anti-MICA antibody had a graft survival 89.3% as compared to 94.7% in patients without anti-MICA antibody (P < 0.05). The hazard ratio for all patients was 3.0701 (P < 0.05). Out of the 340 patients with no HLA antibodies, the presence of anti-MICA antibodies without any HLA antibodies (n = 43) was associated with poor outcome in the patients (hazard ratio of 2.768, P < 0.05). The presence of MICA antibodies with HLA antibodies did not decrease the graft survival (hazards ratio of 1.3750, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Preformed MICA antibodies independently increase the risk of kidney rejection and therefore recommend that guidelines should be formed for mandatory testing of these antibodies prior to renal transplant.
32112449 | Joint study of the associations of HLA-B and the transmembrane short tandem repeat polymorphism of MICA protein with alopecia areata shows independent associations of both with the disease. BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata (AA) is a skin disease that produces hair loss in patches of skin. The underlying mechanism of AA is a loss of immune privilege of hair follicles, which are then attacked by natural killer (NK) cells. A previous genome-wide association study linked single nucleotide polymorphisms of the protein MHC class I chain-related A (MICA) to this disease. MICA is the ligand for the activating receptor NKG2D, expressed mainly by NK cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. As the aforementioned study did not include short tandem repeats (STRs) of MICA, we decided to study these in relation to AA. AIM: To study the association of STRs with AA, alongside that of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) locus B, which is closely linked to MICA. METHODS: DNA amplicon size analysis was carried out, and HLA-B locus genomic typing was performed by PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotide analysis. RESULTS: We observed an association between AA and both MICA*009 and HLA-B14; associations were also observed between HLA-B alleles and MICA alleles, which have both been previously found to be connected with AA, but never studied together. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that it is important to study HLA-B and MICA together to avoid the influence of their association in experiments in which they are investigated separately.
32180763 | Resistance Profiles of Salmonella Isolates Exposed to Stresses and the Expression of Small Non-coding RNAs. Salmonella can resist various stresses and survive during food processing, storage, and distribution, resulting in potential health risks to consumers. Therefore, evaluation of bacterial survival profiles under various environmental stresses is necessary. In this study, the resistance profiles of five Salmonella isolates [serotypes with Agona, Infantis, Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and a standard strain (ATCC 13076, Enteritidis serotype)] to acidic, hyperosmotic, and oxidative stresses were examined, and the relative expressions of non-coding small RNAs were also evaluated, including CyaR, MicC, MicA, InvR, RybB, and DsrA, induced by specific stresses. The results indicated that although all tested strains displayed a certain resistance to stresses, there was great diversity in stress resistance among the strains. According to the reduction numbers of cells exposed to stress for 3 h, S. Enteritidis showed the highest resistance to acidic and hyperosmotic stresses, whereas ATCC 13076 showed the greatest resistance to oxidative stress, with less than 0.1 Log CFU/ml of cell reduction. Greater resistance of cells to acidic, hyperosmotic, and oxidative stresses was observed within 1 h, after 2 h, and from 1 to 2 h, respectively. The relative expression of sRNAs depended on the isolate for each stress; acidic exposure for the tested isolates induced high expression levels of DsrA, MicC, InvR, RybB, MicA, and CyaR. The sRNA RybB, associated with sigma E and outer membrane protein in bacteria, showed a fold change of greater than 7 in S. Enteritidis exposed to the tested stresses. CyaR and InvR involved in general stress responses and stress adaptation were also induced to show high expression levels of Salmonella exposed to hyperosmotic stress. Overall, these findings demonstrated that the behaviors of Salmonella under specific stresses varied according to strain and were likely not related to other profiles. The finding also provided insights into the survival of Salmonella subjected to short-term stresses and for controlling Salmonella in the food industry.
32211339 | N-Glycans Mediate the Ebola Virus-GP1 Shielding of Ligands to Immune Receptors and Immune Evasion. The Ebola Virus (EBOV) glycoprotein (GP) sterically shields cell-membrane ligands to immune receptors such as human leukocyte antigen class-1 (HLA-I) and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), thus mediating immunity evasion. It was suggested that the abundant N-glycosylation of the EBOV-GP is involved in this steric shielding. We aimed to characterize (i) the GP N-glycosylation sites contributing to the shielding, and (ii) the effect of mutating these sites on immune subversion by the EBOV-GP. The two highly glycosylated domains of GP are the mucin-like domain (MLD) and the glycan cap domain (GCD) with three and six N-glycosylation sites, respectively. We mutated the N-glycosylation sites either in MLD or in GCD or in both domains. We showed that the glycosylation sites in both the MLD and GCD domains contribute to the steric shielding. This was shown for the steric shielding of either HLA-I or MICA. We then employed the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method to measure the effect of N-glycosylation site removal on the distance in the cell membrane between the EBOV-GP and HLA-I (HLA.A*0201 allele). We recorded high FRET values for the interaction of CFP-fused HLA.A*0201 and YFP-fused EBOV-GP, demonstrating the very close distance (<10 nm) between these two proteins on the cell membrane of GP-expressing cells. The co-localization of HLA-I and Ebola GP was unaffected by the disruption of steric shielding, as the removal of N-glycosylation sites on Ebola GP revealed similar FRET values with HLA-I. However, these mutations directed to N-glycosylation sites had restored immune cell function otherwise impaired due to steric shielding over immune cell ligands by WT Ebola GP. Overall, we showed that the GP-mediated steric shielding aimed to impair immune function is facilitated by the N-glycans protruding from its MLD and GCD domains, but these N-glycans are not controlling the close distance between GP and its shielded proteins.
32286503 | Compatibility at amino acid position 98 of MICB reduces the incidence of graft-versus-host disease in conjunction with the CMV status. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related complications are leading causes of mortality after unrelated-donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (UD-HCT). The non-conventional MHC class I gene MICB, alike MICA, encodes a stress-induced polymorphic NKG2D ligand. However, unlike MICA, MICB interacts with the CMV-encoded UL16, which sequestrates MICB intracellularly, leading to immune evasion. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the impact of mismatches in MICB amino acid position 98 (MICB98), a key polymorphic residue involved in UL16 binding, in 943 UD-HCT pairs who were allele-matched at HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and MICA loci. HLA-DP typing was further available. MICB98 mismatches were significantly associated with an increased incidence of acute (grade II-IV: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.24; P < 0.001; grade III-IV: HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.56 to 3.34; P < 0.001) and chronic GVHD (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.33; P < 0.001). MICB98 matching significantly reduced the effect of CMV status on overall mortality from a hazard ratio of 1.77 to 1.16. MICB98 mismatches showed a GVHD-independent association with a higher incidence of CMV infection/reactivation (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.51; P < 0.001). Hence selecting a MICB98-matched donor significantly reduces the GVHD incidence and lowers the impact of CMV status on overall survival.
32519199 | Association of MICA gene polymorphisms with thionamide-induced agranulocytosis. BACKGROUND: Thionamide-induced agranulocytosis (TIA), namely antithyroid drug (ATD)-induced agranulocytosis, is one of the most feared adverse effect of ATDs. It is defined as a granulocyte count of less than 0.5 x 109/L after ATD administration. Several studies reported that TIA is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and nearby genes. Our previous study found that the susceptibility genes of TIA are similar in north China and European populations. METHODS: We evaluated the associations of 23 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 37 patients with TIA and 254 patients with Graves' disease (GD) as controls by iPLEX MassARRAY system. RESULTS: Five SNPs in the MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A(MICA) genes [rs4349859 (p = 1.43E-7); rs145575084 (p = 5.79E-6); rs116135464 (p = 3.70E-5); rs148015908 (p = 3.79E-5) and rs189600525 (p = 2.15E-4)] were found to be significantly associated with TIA after Bonferroni correction. After combining with previous data of rs4349859 and HLA-B*27:05, the haplotype analysis showed that patients carrying P-A-C-A-T-T-A haplotype have a higher risk of TIA (p = 9.76E-7; OR = 14.85, 95% CI 3.63-60.77). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that five high linked SNPs of MICA gene are significantly associated with susceptibility to TIA.
32656310 | Systematic literature review on novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2: a threat to human era. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh-generation coronavirus family causing viral pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across globe affecting millions of people. The objectives of this study are to (1) identify the major research themes in COVID-19 literature, (2) determine the origin, symptoms and modes of transmission of COVID, (3) recommend the intervention and mitigation strategies adopted by the Governments globally against the spread of COVID-19 and the traumatization among the public? and (4) study the possible drugs/treatment plans against COVID-19. A systematic literature review and comprehensive analysis of 38 research articles on COVID-19 are conducted. An integrated Research focus parallel-ship network and keyword co-occurrence analysis are carried out to visualize the three research concepts in COVID-19 literature. Some of our observations include: (1) as SARS-CoV-2's RNA matches ~ 96% to SARS-CoV, it is assumed to be transmitted from the bats. (2) The common symptoms are high fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, diarrhoea etc. (3) A lockdown across 180 affected counties for more than a month with social-distancing and the precautions taken in SARS and MERS are recommended by the Governments. (4) Researchers' claim that nutrition and immunity enhancers and treatment plans such as arbidol, lopinavir/ritonavir, convalescent plasma and mesenchymal stem cells and drugs including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and favipiravir are effective against COVID-19. This complied report serves as guide to help the administrators, researchers and the medical officers to adopt recommended intervention strategies and the optimal treatment/drug against COVID-19.
32737971 | Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Chain-Related A and B (MICA and MICB) Gene, Allele, and Haplotype Associations With Dengue Infections in Ethnic Thais. BACKGROUND: Major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related (MIC) A and B (MICA and MICB) are polymorphic stress molecules recognized by natural killer cells. This study was performed to analyze MIC gene profiles in hospitalized Thai children with acute dengue illness. METHODS: MIC allele profiles were determined in a discovery cohort of patients with dengue fever or dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) (n = 166) and controls (n = 149). A replication cohort of patients with dengue (n = 222) was used to confirm specific MICB associations with disease. RESULTS: MICA*045 and MICB*004 associated with susceptibility to DHF in secondary dengue virus (DENV) infections (odds ratio [OR], 3.22; [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-8.84] and 1.99 [1.07-2.13], respectively), and MICB*002 with protection from DHF in secondary DENV infections (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, .21-.68). The protective effect of MICB*002 against secondary DHF was confirmed in the replication cohort (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, .22-.82) and was stronger when MICB*002 is present in individuals also carrying HLA-B*18, B*40, and B*44 alleles which form the B44 supertype of functionally related alleles (0.29, 95% CI, .14-.60). CONCLUSIONS: Given that MICB*002 is a low expresser of soluble proteins, these data indicate that surface expression of MICB*002 with B44 supertype alleles on DENV-infected cells confer a protective advantage in controlling DENV infection using natural killer cells.
32749759 | Exploring the growth of COVID-19 cases using exponential modelling across 42 countries and predicting signs of early containment using machine learning. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic spread by the single-stranded RNA severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the seventh generation of the coronavirus family. Following an unusual replication mechanism, its extreme ease of transmissivity has put many countries under lockdown. With the uncertainty of developing a cure/vaccine for the infection in the near future, the onus currently lies on healthcare infrastructure, policies, government activities, and behaviour of the people to contain the virus. This research uses exponential growth modelling studies to understand the spreading patterns of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies countries that showed early signs of containment until March 26, 2020. Predictive supervised machine learning models are built using infrastructure, environment, policies, and infection-related independent variables to predict early containment. COVID-19 infection data across 42 countries are used. Logistic regression results show a positive significant relationship between healthcare infrastructure and lockdown policies, and signs of early containment. Machine learning models based on logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machines are developed and show accuracies between 76.2% and 92.9% to predict early signs of infection containment. Other policies and the decisions taken by countries to contain the infection are also discussed.
32831971 | Investigating the GWAS-Implicated Loci for Rheumatoid Arthritis in the Pakistani Population. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex and multifactorial autoimmune disorder with the involvement of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 50 RA genetic loci in European populations. Given the anticipated overlap of RA-relevant genes and pathways across different ethnic groups, we sought to replicate 58 GWAS-implicated SNPs reported in Europeans in Pakistani subjects. 1,959 unrelated subjects comprising 1,222 RA cases and 737 controls were collected from three rheumatology facilities in Pakistan. Genotyping was performed using iPLEX or TaqMan  methods. A total of 50 SNPs were included in the final association analysis after excluding those that failed assay design/run or postrun QC analysis. Fourteen SNPs (LINC00824/rs1516971, PADI4/rs2240336, CEP57/rs4409785, CTLA4/rs3087243, STAT4/rs13426947, HLA-B/MICA/rs2596565, C5orf30/rs26232, CCL21/rs951005, GATA3/rs2275806, VPS37C/rs595158, HLA-DRB1/rs660895, EOMES/rs3806624, SPRED2/rs934734, and RUNX1/rs9979383) were replicated in our Pakistani sample at false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.20 with nominal p values ranging from 4.73E-06 to 3.48E-02. Our results indicate that several RA susceptibility loci are shared between Pakistani and European populations, supporting the role of common genes/pathways.
32832246 | Nanoscale Characteristics of Ocular Lipid Thin Films Using Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy. Purpose: To describe the use of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to investigate the electrical surface potential of human meibum and to demonstrate successful use of this instrument on both human meibum and a meibum model system (six-lipid stock [6LS]) to elucidate nanoscale surface chemistry and self-assembly characteristics. Materials and Methods: 6LS and meibum were analyzed in this study. Mica-supported thin films were created using the Langmuir-Blodgett trough. Topography and electrical surface potential were quantified using simultaneous atomic force microscopy/KPFM imaging. Results: Both lipid mixtures formed thin film patches on the surface of the mica substrate, with large aggregates resting atop. The 6LS had aggregate heights ranging from 41 to 153 nm. The range in surface potential was 33.0 to 125.9 mV. The meibum thin films at P = 5 mN/m had aggregates of 170 to 459 nm in height and surface potential ranging from 15.9 to 76.1 mV, while thin films at P = 10 mN/m showed an aggregate size range of 147 to 407 nm and a surface potential range of 11.5 to 255.1 mV. Conclusions: This study showed imaging of the differences in electrical surface potential of meibum via KPFM and showed similarities in nanoscale topography. 6LS was also successfully analyzed, showing the capabilities of this method for use in both in vitro and ex vivo ocular research. Translational Relevance: This study describes the use of KPFM for the study of ocular surface lipids for the first time and outlines possibilities for future studies to be carried out using this concept.
33017098 | MICA polymorphisms associated with antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis in the Chinese Han population. BACKGROUND: Graves' disease (GD) is a clinical autoimmune thyroid disease. During the treatment of GD, antithyroid drug-induced agranulocytosis (TIA) is a common and even life-threatening adverse drug reaction. Previous studies suggested that susceptibility to TIA is strongly associated with HLA-B*27:05, HLA-B*38:02, and HLA-DRB1*08:03 genetic variation and six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in MICA genes. AIMS: The purpose of this study is to further study the associations between TIA, HLA-B and MICA. MATERIALS & METHODS: We genotyped MICA-STR and MICA-129 variants in 41 TIA and 308 control patients with GD and investigated the linkage effect among SNPs and short tandem repeat (STR) of MICA and HLA-B alleles. RESULTS: The results showed that MICA*A5.1 was significantly associated with TIA (p = .007, odd ratio = 1.958, 95% confidence interval, 1.192-3.214). In addition, high linkage among MICA-129 and six SNPs MICA and HLA-B was detected, and two haplotypes (AAAACAAAAACGGCCTA and AACAAAAAAAACATTAA (p = 5.14E-07 and p = 3.42E-08, respectively)) were significantly associated with TIA. Furthermore, when we analyzed only MICA-129 and HLA-B separately, the haplotypes (AAAACAAAAAA with p = 2.49E-07 and AACAAAAAAAA with p = 2.14E-09) were identified with more significant effects. MICA-129 was completely linked to six SNPs with haplotypes ACATTACA (p = 2.05E-05) significantly associated with TIA. CONCLUSION: These data indicated that there was a significant linkage effect between MICA-129 and other alleles, suggesting that they exert interactive effects as risk factors for the development of TIA.
33151039 | Association of MICA and HLA-B alleles with leprosy in two endemic populations in Brazil. Leprosy is a prevalent disease in Brazil, which ranks as the country with the second highest number of cases in the world. The disease manifests in a spectrum of forms, and genetic differences in the host can help to elucidate the immunopathogenesis. For a better understanding of MICA association with leprosy, we performed a case-control and a family-based study in two endemic populations in Brazil. MICA and HLA-B alleles were evaluated in 409 leprosy patients and in 419 healthy contacts by PCR-SSOP-Luminex-based technology. In the familial study, analysis of 46 families was completed by direct sequencing of all exons and 3'/5'untranslated regions, using the Ilumina MiSeq platform. All data were collected between 2006 and 2009. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test together with a multivariate analysis. Family-based association was assessed by transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) software FBAT 2.0.4. We found associations between the haplotype MICA*002-HLA-B*35 with leprosy in both the per se and the multibacillary (MB) forms when compared to healthy contacts. The MICA allele *008 was associated with the clinical forms of paucibacillary (PB). Additionally, MICA*029 was associated with the clinical forms of MB. The association of MICA*029 allele (MICA-A4 variant) with the susceptibility to the MB form suggests this variant for the transmembrane domain of the MICA molecule may be a risk factor for leprosy. Two MICA and nine HLA-B variants were found associated with leprosy per se in the Colonia do Prata population. Linkage disequilibrium analysis revealed perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) between HLA-B markers rs2596498 and rs2507992, and high LD (R2  = .92) between these and the marker rs2442718. This familial study demonstrates that MICA association signals are not independent from those observed for HLA-B. Our findings contribute the knowledge pool of the immunogenetics of Hansen's disease and reveals a new association of the MICA*029 allele.

33247940 | Increased expression of interleukin-21-inducible genes in minor salivary glands are associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome disease characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To determine the upregulation of IL-21-inducible genes in minor salivary glands (MSGs) in 28 primary SS (pSS) patients and 12 non-pSS subjects and correlate it with disease characteristics. METHODS: RNA sequencing was utilized to compare IL-21-inducible genes expression in the MSGs between pSS and non-pSS subjects. The subgroups were characterized according to the IL-21 score calculated by seven IL-21-inducible genes. Furthermore, the disease characteristics and transcripts implicated in hypoxia and interferon signalling were assessed in two pSS subgroups. RESULTS: We observed that the expression of the IL-21-inducible genes (IL-21, IL-21R, JAK3, STAT1, HLA-B, CCR7 and CXCL10), the so-called IL-21 signature genes, was significantly increased in pSS patients. The upregulation of JAK3 expression may be induced by hypomethylation of the JAK3 promoter in pSS patients and putatively associated with POU2F2. The patients with increased IL-21 signature gene expression showed an increased EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index score and increased enrichment of B cells, memory B cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the IL-21 scores in the anti-SSA+, SSB+, ANA+ and high IgG samples were higher than those in the respective antibody-negative samples and normal IgG. In addition, we found both hypoxia and IFN-relevant genes showed strong correlation with IL-21 signature gene expression, indicating their interaction in pSS. CONCLUSION: IL-21 signature gene was associated with typical disease characteristics in pSS, which provides insight into the contribution of the IL-21 signalling pathway to the pathogenesis of the disease and might provide a novel treatment strategy for this subtype of pSS.
33537058 | SNP-Density Crossover Maps of Polymorphic Transposable Elements and HLA Genes Within MHC Class I Haplotype Blocks and Junction. The genomic region (~4 Mb) of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is a prime model for the study and understanding of conserved polymorphic sequences (CPSs) and structural diversity of ancestral haplotypes (AHs)/conserved extended haplotypes (CEHs). The aim of this study was to use a set of 95 MHC genomic sequences downloaded from a publicly available BioProject database at NCBI to identify and characterise polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes and pseudogenes, MICA and MICB, and retroelement indels as haplotypic lineage markers, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) crossover loci in DNA sequence alignments of different haplotypes across the Olfactory Receptor (OR) gene region (~1.2 Mb) and the MHC class I region (~1.8 Mb) from the GPX5 to the MICB gene. Our comparative sequence analyses confirmed the identity of 12 haplotypic retroelement markers and revealed that they partitioned the HLA-A/B/C haplotypes into distinct evolutionary lineages. Crossovers between SNP-poor and SNP-rich regions defined the sequence range of haplotype blocks, and many of these crossover junctions occurred within particular transposable elements, lncRNA, OR12D2, MUC21, MUC22, PSORS1A3, HLA-C, HLA-B, and MICA. In a comparison of more than 250 paired sequence alignments, at least 38 SNP-density crossover sites were mapped across various regions from GPX5 to MICB. In a homology comparison of 16 different haplotypes, seven CEH/AH (7.1, 8.1, 18.2, 51.x, 57.1, 62.x, and 62.1) had no detectable SNP-density crossover junctions and were SNP poor across the entire ~2.8 Mb of sequence alignments. Of the analyses between different recombinant haplotypes, more than half of them had SNP crossovers within 10 kb of LTR16B/ERV3-16A3_I, MLT1, Charlie, and/or THE1 sequences and were in close vicinity to structurally polymorphic Alu and SVA insertion sites. These studies demonstrate that (1) SNP-density crossovers are associated with putative ancestral recombination sites that are widely spread across the MHC class I genomic region from at least the telomeric OR12D2 gene to the centromeric MICB gene and (2) the genomic sequences of MHC homozygous cell lines are useful for analysing haplotype blocks, ancestral haplotypic landscapes and markers, CPSs, and SNP-density crossover junctions.
33554868 | Engineering Tolerance toward Allogeneic CAR-T Cells by Regulation of MHC Surface Expression with Human Herpes Virus-8 Proteins. Allogeneic, off-the-shelf (OTS) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cell therapies have the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and variability while providing broader accessibility to cancer patients and those with other diseases. However, host-versus-graft reactivity can limit the durability and efficacy of OTS cell therapies requiring new strategies to evade adaptive and innate-immune responses. Human herpes virus-8 (HHV8) maintains infection, in part, by evading host T and natural killer (NK) cell attack. The viral K3 gene encodes a membrane-tethered E3 ubiquitin ligase that discretely targets major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I components, whereas K5 encodes a similar E3 ligase with broader specificity, including MHC-II and the MHC-like MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MIC-A)- and sequence B (MIC-B)-activating ligands of NK cells. We created gamma-retroviruses encoding K3 and/or K5 transgenes that efficiently transduce primary human T cells. Expression of K3 or K5 resulted in dramatic downregulation of MHC-IA (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A, -B, and -C) and MHC class II (HLA-DR) cell-surface expression. K3 expression was sufficient for T cells to resist exogenously loaded peptide-MHC-specific cytotoxicity, as well as recognition in one-way allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions. Further, in immunodeficient mice engrafted with allogeneic T cells, K3-transduced T cells selectively expanded in vivo. Ectopic K5 expression in MHC class I-, MIC-A+/B+ K562 cells also reduced targeting by primary NK cells. Coexpression of K3 in prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA)-directed, inducible MyD88/CD40 (iMC)-enhanced CAR-T cells did not impact cytotoxicity, T cell growth, or cytokine production against HPAC pancreatic tumor target cells, whereas K5-expressing cells showed a modest reduction in interleukin (IL)-2 production without effect on cytotoxicity. Together, these results support application of these E3 ligases to advance development of OTS CAR-T cell products.
33599111 | High-throughput genotyping of HLA-G, HLA-F, MICA, and MICB and analysis of frequency distributions in healthy blood donors from Catalonia. Similarly to HLA class I molecules, certain non-classical HLA class I genes and MHC class I polypeptide-related sequences A and B (MICA and MICB) act as ligands for KIR and NKG2D natural killer receptors. Although these genes are less polymorphic than HLA class I, few studies have analyzed their association with diseases. Information on allele frequencies in healthy donors is needed to map their distribution worldwide. This study is the first to analyze high-resolution HLA-G, HLA-F, MICA, and MICB allele frequencies using a novel high-throughput next generation-sequencing method. We analyzed DNA samples from 96 unrelated blood donors resident in Catalonia, Spain, and registered in the Barcelona Blood and Tissue Bank. Using the first two fields of the HLA nomenclature, we detected six HLA-G and two HLA-F alleles. The most frequent alleles were HLA-G*01:01 (77.08%) and HLA-F*01:01(84.90%). When the four fields were analyzed, we detected 16 and 10 alleles, respectively. Nineteen alleles were detected for MICA and 10 for MICB. The most frequent alleles in these cases were MICA*008:01 (16.15%) and MICB*005:02 (46.84%). All frequencies were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium except MICA. We also estimated maximum-likelihood haplotype frequencies and calculated corresponding linkage disequilibrium (LD) values and found that few allele pairs were in disequilibrium. Strong LD between MICA and HLA-B (using data from a previous study) was observed. Our findings will be useful for guiding further research evaluating the functional role of these genes in different diseases and populations.
33732254 | Phenotype, Susceptibility, Autoimmunity, and Immunotherapy Between Kawasaki Disease and Coronavirus Disease-19 Associated Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in children is usually mild but some are susceptible to a Kawasaki disease (KD)-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) in the convalescent stage, posing a need to differentiate the phenotype, susceptibility, autoimmunity, and immunotherapy between KD and MIS-C, particularly in the upcoming mass vaccination of COVID-19. Patients with MIS-C are prone to gastrointestinal symptoms, coagulopathy, and shock in addition to atypical KD syndrome with fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and/or cardiovascular events. MIS-C manifests KD-like symptoms that alert physicians to early recognize and adopt the KD treatment regimen for patients with MIS-C. MIS-C linked to COVID-19 teaches us infection-associated autoimmune vasculitis and vice versa. Studies on genetic susceptibility have identified certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and toll-like receptor (TLR) associated with KD and/or COVID-19. Certain HLA subtypes, such as HLA-DRB1 and HLA-MICA A4 are associated with KD. HLA-B*46:01 is proposed to be the risk allele of severe COVID-19 infection, and blood group O type is a protective factor of COVID-19. The autoimmune vasculitis of KD, KD shock syndrome (KDSS), or MIS-C is mediated by a genetic variant of HLA, FcgammaR, and/or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) resulting in hyperinflammation with T helper 17 (Th17)/Treg imbalance with augmented Th17/Th1 mediators: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interferon (IFNgamma), and IL-17A, and lower expression of Treg-signaling molecules, FoxP3, and transforming growth factor (TGF-beta). There are certain similarities and differences in phenotypes, susceptibility, and pathogenesis of KD, KDSS, and MIS-C, by which a physician can make early protection, prevention, and precision treatment of the diseases. The evolution of immunotherapies for the diseases has shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or combined with corticosteroids is the standard treatment for KD, KDSS, and MIS-C. However, a certain portion of patients who revealed a treatment resistance to IVIG or IVIG plus corticosteroids, posing a need to early identify the immunopathogenesis, to protect hosts with genetic susceptibility, and to combat Th17/Treg imbalance by anti-cytokine or pro-Treg for reversal of the hyperinflammation and IVIG resistance. Based on physiological and pathological immunity of the diseases under genetic susceptibility and host milieu conditions, a series of sequential regimens are provided to develop a so-called \Know thyself, enemy (pathogen), and ever-victorious\ strategy for the prevention and immunotherapy of KD and/or MIS-C.
33767422 | Breast cancer management pathways during the COVID-19 pandemic: outcomes from the UK 'Alert Level 4' phase of the B-MaP-C study. BACKGROUND: The B-MaP-C study aimed to determine alterations to breast cancer (BC) management during the peak transmission period of the UK COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of these treatment decisions. METHODS: This was a national cohort study of patients with early BC undergoing multidisciplinary team (MDT)-guided treatment recommendations during the pandemic, designated 'standard' or 'COVID-altered', in the preoperative, operative and post-operative setting. FINDINGS: Of 3776 patients (from 64 UK units) in the study, 2246 (59%) had 'COVID-altered' management. 'Bridging' endocrine therapy was used (n = 951) where theatre capacity was reduced. There was increasing access to COVID-19 low-risk theatres during the study period (59%). In line with national guidance, immediate breast reconstruction was avoided (n = 299). Where adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted (n = 81), the median benefit was only 3% (IQR 2-9%) using 'NHS Predict'. There was the rapid adoption of new evidence-based hypofractionated radiotherapy (n = 781, from 46 units). Only 14 patients (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during their treatment journey. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of 'COVID-altered' management decisions were largely in line with pre-COVID evidence-based guidelines, implying that breast cancer survival outcomes are unlikely to be negatively impacted by the pandemic. However, in this study, the potential impact of delays to BC presentation or diagnosis remains unknown.
33793006 | Features of HLA class I expression and its clinical relevance in SARS-CoV-2: What do we know so far? Modifications in HLA-I expression are found in many viral diseases. They represent one of the immune evasion strategies most widely used by viruses to block antigen presentation and NK cell response, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. These alterations result from a combination of virus-specific factors, genetically encoded mechanisms, and the status of host defences and range from loss or upregulation of HLA-I molecules to selective increases of HLA-I alleles. In this review, I will first analyse characteristic features of altered HLA-I expression found in SARS-CoV-2. I will then discuss the potential factors underlying these defects, focussing on HLA-E and class-I-related (like) molecules and their receptors, the most documented HLA-I alterations. I will also draw attention to potential differences between cells transfected to express viral proteins and those presented as part of authentic infection. Consideration of these factors and others affecting HLA-I expression may provide us with improved possibilities for research into cellular immunity against viral variants.
33910591 | HLA-A2.1-restricted ECM1-derived epitope LA through DC cross-activation priming CD8+ T and NK cells: a novel therapeutic tumour vaccine. BACKGROUND: CD8+ T cell-mediated adaptive cellular immunity and natural killer (NK) cell-mediated innate immunity both play important roles in tumour immunity. This study aimed to develop therapeutic tumour vaccines based on double-activation of CD8+ T and NK cells. METHODS: The immune Epitope database, Molecular Operating Environment software, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used for epitope identification. Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, UPLC-QTOF-MS, and RNA-seq were utilized for evaluating immunity of PBMC-derived DCs, CD8+ T or NK cells and related pathways. HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice combined with immunologically reconstituted tumour-bearing mice were used to examine the antitumour effect and safety of epitope vaccines. RESULTS: We identified novel HLA-A2.1-restricted extracellular matrix protein 1(ECM1)-derived immunodominant epitopes in which LA induced a potent immune response. We also found that LA-loaded DCs upregulated the frequency of CD3+/CD8+ T cells, CD45RO+/CD69+ activated memory T cells, and CD3-/CD16+/CD56+ NK cells. We demonstrated cytotoxic granule release of LA/DC-CTLs or LA/DC-NK cells and cytotoxicity against tumour cells and microtissue blocks via the predominant IFN-gamma/perforin/granzyme B cell death pathway. Further investigating the mechanism of LA-mediated CD8+ T activation, we found that LA could be internalized into DCs through phagocytosis and then formed a LA-MHC-I complex presented onto the DC surface for recognition of the T cell receptor to upregulate Zap70 phosphorylation levels to further activate CD8+ T cells by DC-CTL interactions. In addition, LA-mediated DC-NK crosstalk through stimulation of the TLR4-p38 MAPK pathway increased MICA/B expression on DCs to interact with NKG2D for NK activation. Promisingly, LA could activate CD8+ T cells and NK cells simultaneously via interacting with DCs to suppress tumours in vivo. Moreover, the safety of LA was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS: LA-induced immune antitumour activity through DC cross-activation with CD8+ T and NK cells, which demonstrated proof-of-concept evidence for the capability and safety of a novel therapeutic tumour vaccine.
34042687 | Facilitating Study and Item Level Browsing for Clinical and Epidemiological COVID-19 Studies. COVID-19 poses a major challenge to individuals and societies around the world. Yet, it is difficult to obtain a good overview of studies across different medical fields of research such as clinical trials, epidemiology, and public health. Here, we describe a consensus metadata model to facilitate structured searches of COVID-19 studies and resources along with its implementation in three linked complementary web-based platforms. A relational database serves as central study metadata hub that secures compatibilities with common trials registries (e.g. ICTRP and standards like HL7 FHIR, CDISC ODM, and DataCite). The Central Search Hub was developed as a single-page application, the other two components with additional frontends are based on the SEEK platform and MICA, respectively. These platforms have different features concerning cohort browsing, item browsing, and access to documents and other study resources to meet divergent user needs. By this we want to promote transparent and harmonized COVID-19 research.
34543608 | An appeal for an objective, open, and transparent scientific debate about the origin of SARS-CoV-2. 
34561127 | Current strategies for intratumoural immunotherapy - Beyond immune checkpoint inhibition. Immunotherapy has revolutionised cancer treatment through restoration of host antitumour immune response. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) confer durable responses in only a subset of patients. Mechanisms of ICI resistance to improve durable response rates and overall survival are an area of intense clinical research. Robust clinical development is ongoing to evaluate novel combination therapies to overcome ICI resistance, including targeting immunoregulatory pathways in the tumour microenvironment. Intratumoural (IT) immunotherapies such as toll-like receptor agonists, stimulator of interferon-induced gene agonists, retinoic-inducible gene I-like receptor agonists and oncolytic viruses may represent potential combination treatment options to overcome ICI resistance. Use of IT immunotherapies in combination with ICIs may alter the tumour microenvironment to address resistance mechanisms and improve antitumour response. Optimisation of IT immunotherapy clinical trials will elucidate resistance mechanisms, facilitate clinical trial design, define pharmacodynamic predictors that identify patients who may most benefit and inform clinical development of combination immunotherapy regimens. Here we provide an overview of IT immunotherapy principles, mechanisms of action, categories of IT immunotherapeutics, emerging data, clinical development strategies, response assessment, dose and schedule determination, clinical trial design and translational study design.
34650566 | MHC Variants Associated With Symptomatic Versus Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Highly Exposed Individuals. Despite the high number of individuals infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms worldwide, many exposed individuals remain asymptomatic and/or uninfected and seronegative. This could be explained by a combination of environmental (exposure), immunological (previous infection), epigenetic, and genetic factors. Aiming to identify genetic factors involved in immune response in symptomatic COVID-19 as compared to asymptomatic exposed individuals, we analyzed 83 Brazilian couples where one individual was infected and symptomatic while the partner remained asymptomatic and serum-negative for at least 6 months despite sharing the same bedroom during the infection. We refer to these as \discordant couples\. We performed whole-exome sequencing followed by a state-of-the-art method to call genotypes and haplotypes across the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. The discordant partners had comparable ages and genetic ancestry, but women were overrepresented (65%) in the asymptomatic group. In the antigen-presentation pathway, we observed an association between HLA-DRB1 alleles encoding Lys at residue 71 (mostly DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*04:01) and DOB*01:02 with symptomatic infections and HLA-A alleles encoding 144Q/151R with asymptomatic seronegative women. Among the genes related to immune modulation, we detected variants in MICA and MICB associated with symptomatic infections. These variants are related to higher expression of soluble MICA and low expression of MICB. Thus, quantitative differences in these molecules that modulate natural killer (NK) activity could contribute to susceptibility to COVID-19 by downregulating NK cell cytotoxic activity in infected individuals but not in the asymptomatic partners.
34905179 | CD48-expressing non-small-cell lung cancer cells are susceptible to natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The susceptibility of cancer cells to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity depends on the balance of activating and inhibitory ligands expressed on their surface. Although many types of cancer cells are killed by NK cells, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells are relatively resistant to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this study, we showed that several NSCLC cell lines have differential sensitivity to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity: NCI-H522 cells were highly sensitive, but A549, NCI-H23, NCI-H1915, and NCI-H1299 were resistant. Among activating ligands such as CD48, HLA-A/B/G, ICAM-1, MICA/B, and ULBPs, only CD48 rendered NCI-H522 cells susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which was proved by using CD48 siRNA and neutralizing antibody. CD48-positive NCI-H522 cells established a more stable contact with NK cells than did CD48-negative A549 and CD48 siRNA cell-transfected NCI-H522 cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CD48-positive NSCLC cells might be susceptible to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which provide information on how to stratify NSCLC patients potentially responsive to NK-cell therapy.
34921518 | Natural killer cell receptors and ligand variants modulate response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although survival rates have improved, response to these treatments is highly heterogeneous. Variations in response rates may be due to different causes such as, treatment adherence, mutations in the BCR-ABL1 gene, clonal evolution and amplification of the BCR-ABL1 gene, but innate immune response is also considered to play a very important role and, specifically, NK cell activity through their receptors and ligands, could be determinant. The aim of this retrospective study was to explore the role of different activating and inhibiting KIR genes as well as the activating NKG2D receptor, present in NK cells, and also their respective ligands, HLA-A, -B, -C, -G, -F, MICA and MICB, in the progression of 190 patients with CML and treated at two hospitals from Barcelona between 2000 and 2019. Early molecular response (EMR), major molecular response (MMR) or MR3.0 and deep molecular response (DMR) or MR4.0 were correlated. As control samples, healthy donors from the Barcelona Blood Bank were analyzed. The presence of KIR2DL2/KIR2DS2 was associated with the achievement of EMR, MR3.0, and MR4.0. Carriers of the higher expression NKG2D variant and MICA*009:01 were also likely to achieve molecular response (MR). The most remarkable difference between CML patients and controls was a higher frequency of the lower expression NKG2D variant in CML patients. In summary, our results showed that activating NK receptor phenotypes might help to achieve MR and DMR in CML patients treated with TKIs although confirmatory studies are necessary.
35195391 | Hydrophilic-Hydrophobic Nanohybrids of AuNP-Immobilized Two-Dimensional Nanomica Platelets as Flexible Substrates for High-Efficiency and High-Selectivity Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Microbe Detection. A flexible hybrid substrate was developed by affixing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) onto the surface of two-dimensional nanomica platelets (NMPs). The substrate was successfully used in biosensors with high efficiency and high selectivity through surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). By controlling the amphiphilicity of the hybrid substrate, the flexible substrate was made highly selective toward biomolecules. Four different SERS substrate systems were constructed, including intercalated mica, exfoliated NMPs, hydrophilic exfoliated NMPs, and hydrophobic exfoliated NMPs. NMPs were only 1 nm thick. AuNPs adsorbed on both sides of NMPs and thus created excellent three-dimensional hot junction effects in the z-axis direction. For the detection of adenine in DNA, a satisfactory Raman enhancement factor (EF) of up to 8.9 x 106 was achieved with the detection limit as low as 10-8 M. Subsequently, the AuNP/NMP hybrids were adopted to rapidly detect hydrophilic Staphylococcus hominis and hydrophobic Escherichia coli. The AuNP/PIB-POE-PIB/NMP nanohybrid was concurrently hydrophilic and hydrophobic. This amphiphilic property greatly enhanced the detection selectivity and signal intensity for hydrophilic or hydrophobic bacteria. Overall, AuNPs/PIB-POE-PIB/NMPs developed as SERS substrates enable rapid, sensitive biodetection.
35481955 | Prognostic Value of Serum MICA Levels as a Marker of Severity in COVID-19 Patients. The COVID-19 global pandemic and high mortality rates necessitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools, as well as expanding testing capacity. Existing methods for detecting and characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection are typically based on viral genome detection or measuring COVID-19-specific antibody levels. Despite their value, these methods are unable to predict disease outcomes in patients. Given the critical role of innate immune cells, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, in antiviral defense, this study sought to determine the prognostic value of serum secretory MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (sMICA) levels as an essential ligand for the NKG2D receptor, the master regulator of NK cell development and responsiveness. Serum MICA levels were measured by ELISA assay. Sera (n = 60) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were collected, and disease severity was determined using clinical criteria. The patient group included 30 patients with mild disease and 30 severely ill patients, as well as 30 healthy controls. Our findings revealed that serum MICA levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls, especially in cases with severe complications (P < .0001). Higher serum MICA levels may be associated with respiratory failure in COVID-19 and may serve as a marker of clinical severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, particularly when clinical manifestations are insufficient to make a confident prediction.
35587364 | SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff impacts innate NK cell functions, but antibody-dependent NK activity is strongly activated through non-spike antibodies. The outcome of infection is dependent on the ability of viruses to manipulate the infected cell to evade immunity, and the ability of the immune response to overcome this evasion. Understanding this process is key to understanding pathogenesis, genetic risk factors, and both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. SARS-CoV-2 antagonises the innate interferon response, but whether it manipulates innate cellular immunity is unclear. An unbiased proteomic analysis determined how cell surface protein expression is altered on SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells, showing downregulation of activating NK ligands B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1, with minimal effects on MHC-I. This occurred at the level of protein synthesis, could be mediated by Nsp1 and Nsp14, and correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation. This identifies a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 host-shutoff antagonises innate immunity. Later in the disease process, strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed. These responses were sustained for at least 6 months in most patients, and led to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose. These insights have important implications for understanding disease progression, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine design.
35805975 | Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I Chain-Related alpha (MICA) STR Polymorphisms in COVID-19 Patients. The SARS-CoV-2 disease presents different phenotypes of severity. Comorbidities, age, and being overweight are well established risk factors for severe disease. However, innate immunity plays a key role in the early control of viral infections and may condition the gravity of COVID-19. Natural Killer (NK) cells are part of innate immunity and are important in the control of virus infection by killing infected cells and participating in the development of adaptive immunity. Therefore, we studied the short tandem repeat (STR) transmembrane polymorphisms of the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A (MICA), an NKG2D ligand that induces activation of NK cells, among other cells. We compared the alleles and genotypes of MICA in COVID-19 patients versus healthy controls and analyzed their relation to disease severity. Our results indicate that the MICA*A9 allele is related to infection as well as to symptomatic disease but not to severe disease. The MICA*A9 allele may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic disease.
36293231 | SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (RBD) Subunit Adsorption at Abiotic Surfaces and Corona Formation at Polymer Particles. The adsorption kinetics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit with the receptor binding domain at abiotic surfaces was investigated. A combination of sensitive methods was used such as atomic force microscopy yielding a molecular resolution, a quartz microbalance, and optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy. The two latter methods yielded in situ information about the protein adsorption kinetics under flow conditions. It was established that at pH 3.5-4 the protein adsorbed on mica and silica surfaces in the form of compact quasi-spherical aggregates with an average size of 14 nm. The maximum coverage of the layers was equal to 3 and 1 mg m-2 at pH 4 and 7.4, respectively. The experimental data were successfully interpreted in terms of theoretical results derived from modeling. The experiments performed for flat substrates were complemented by investigations of the protein corona formation at polymer particles carried out using in situ laser Doppler velocimetry technique. In this way, the zeta potential of the protein layers was acquired as a function of the coverage. Applying the electrokinetic model, these primary data were converted to the dependence of the subunit zeta potential on pH. It was shown that a complete acid-base characteristic of the layer can be acquired only using nanomolar quantities of the protein.
36338974 | A gene expression signature in HER2+ breast cancer patients related to neoadjuvant chemotherapy resistance, overall survival, and disease-free survival. Breast cancer ranks first in terms of mortality and incidence rates worldwide among women. The HER2+ molecular subtype is one of the most aggressive subtypes; its treatment includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the use of a HER2 antibody. Some patients develop resistance despite positive results obtained using this therapeutic strategy. OBJECTIVE: To identify prognostic markers for treatment and survival in HER2+ patients. METHODS: Patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assigned to sensitive and resistant groups based on their treatment response. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using RNA-seq analysis. KEGG pathway, gene ontology, and interactome analyses were performed for all DEGs. An enrichment analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed. All DEGs were analyzed for overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 94 DEGs were related to treatment resistance. Survival analysis showed that 12 genes (ATF6B, DHRS13, DIRAS1, ERAL1, GRIN2B, L1CAM, IRX3, PRTFDC1, PBX2, S100B, SLC9A3R2, and TNXB) were good predictors of disease-free survival, and eight genes (GNG4, IL22RA2, MICA, S100B, SERPINF2, HLA-A, DIRAS1, and TNXB) were good predictors of overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION: We highlighted a molecular expression signature that can differentiate the treatment response, overall survival, and DFS of patients with HER2+ breast cancer.
36363472 | Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in a Young Adult (MIC-A) Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection. Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) is a rare but increasingly recognized complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually presenting 2 to 6 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 infection symptoms and affecting mainly children. However, there have been reported several cases of a similar multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A). We describe the case of a previously healthy 28-year-old male who presented with a clinical profile with multiorgan involvement within four weeks after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggestive for multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-A). The clinical presentation included persistent high grade of fever, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, elevated cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers, cytopenia and shock. This case report illustrates the wide range of presentations, diagnosis, and treatment modalities of multisystem inflammatory syndrome. The pathophysiology and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers an abnormal immune response leading to MIS remain poorly understood. Better characterization of MIS-A and early recognition of MIS is important because it is associated with high mortality if left untreated.
36706036 | Anticorrosion Coating with Heterogeneous Assembly of Nanofillers Modulated by a Magnetic Field. An anticorrosive coating with randomly distributed passive barriers and regionally enriched active corrosion inhibitors is developed by integrating mica nanosheets (MNSs) and magnetic-responsive core-shell mesoporous nanoparticles with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (Fe3O4@mSiO2/MBT) under magnetic field incubation. The bottom enriched Fe3O4@mSiO2/MBT rapidly releases the MBT to form a passivation layer on corrosion sites, enhancing the corrosion inhibition efficiency by 30.36% compared with the control (NP0.7EP-R). The impedance modulus  Z 0.01 Hz of the sample (NP0.7/MNS0.5/EP) increases by five orders of magnitude compared with that of its control (NP0.7/MNS0EP) after 30 days of corrosion immersion. NP0.7/MNS0.5/EP exhibited the lowest corrosion rate (3.984 x 10-5 mm/year) as compared to the other samples. Notably, the coating in a fractured state still maintains superior corrosion inhibition even after 40 day salt spray testing. The differentiated distribution of nanofillers was well confirmed by optical microscopy and SEM-EDS, and the synergistic effect of the active/passive integrated anticorrosive coating with merits of both comprehensive protection and fast responsiveness was systematically explored.
37413693 | Physicochemical Nature of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding to Human Vimentin. Vimentin, a protein that builds part of the cytoskeleton and is involved in many aspects of cellular function, was recently identified as a cell surface attachment site for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present study investigated the physicochemical nature of the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 S1 glycoprotein receptor binding domain (S1 RBD) and human vimentin using atomic force microscopy and a quartz crystal microbalance. The molecular interactions of S1 RBD and vimentin proteins were quantified using vimentin monolayers attached to the cleaved mica or a gold microbalance sensor as well as in its native extracellular form present on the live cell surface. The presence of specific interactions between vimentin and S1 RBD was also confirmed using in silico studies. This work provides new evidence that cell-surface vimentin (CSV) functions as a site for SARS-CoV-2 virus attachment and is involved in the pathogenesis of Covid-19, providing a potential target for therapeutic countermeasures.
37427097 | Immune microenvironment analysis and novel biomarkers of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma evolution. Background: Lung cancer is the deadliest and most diagnosed type of cancer worldwide. The 5-year survival rate of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dropped significantly when tumor stages advanced. Patients who received surgically resecting at the pre-invasive stage had a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. However, the study on the differences in gene expression profiles and immune microenvironment among pre-invasive LUAD patients is still lacking. Methods: In this study, the gene expression profiles of three pre-invasive LUAD stages were compared using the RNA-sequencing data of 10 adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) samples, 12 minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) samples, and 10 invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) samples. Results: The high expression levels of PTGFRN (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.45; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.08-1.94; log-rank P = 0.013) and SPP1 (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.07-1.93; log-rank P = 0.015) were identified to be associated with LUAD prognosis. Moreover, the early LUAD invasion was accompanied by the enhancement of antigen presentation ability, reflected by the increase of myeloid dendritic cells infiltration rate (Cuzick test P < 0.01) and the upregulation of seven important genes participating in the antigen presentation, including HLA-A (Cuzick test P = 0.03), MICA (Cuzick test P = 0.01), MICB (Cuzick test P = 0.01), HLA-DPA1 (Cuzick test P = 0.04), HLA-DQA2 (Cuzick test P < 0.01), HLA-DQB1 (Cuzick test P = 0.03), and HLA-DQB2 (Cuzick test P < 0.01). However, the tumor-killing ability of the immune system was inhibited during this process, as there were no rising cytotoxic T cell activity (Cuzick test P = 0.20) and no increasing expression in genes encoding cytotoxic proteins. Conclusion: In all, our research elucidated the changes in the immune microenvironment during early-stage LUAD evolution and may provide a theoretical basis for developing novel early-stage lung cancer therapeutic targets.
37879938 | MICA: a multi-omics method to predict gene regulatory networks in early human embryos. Recent advances in single-cell omics have transformed characterisation of cell types in challenging-to-study biological contexts. In contexts with limited single-cell samples, such as the early human embryo inference of transcription factor-gene regulatory network (GRN) interactions is especially difficult. Here, we assessed application of different linear or non-linear GRN predictions to single-cell simulated and human embryo transcriptome datasets. We also compared how expression normalisation impacts on GRN predictions, finding that transcripts per million reads outperformed alternative methods. GRN inferences were more reproducible using a non-linear method based on mutual information (MI) applied to single-cell transcriptome datasets refined with chromatin accessibility (CA) (called MICA), compared with alternative network prediction methods tested. MICA captures complex non-monotonic dependencies and feedback loops. Using MICA, we generated the first GRN inferences in early human development. MICA predicted co-localisation of the AP-1 transcription factor subunit proto-oncogene JUND and the TFAP2C transcription factor AP-2gamma in early human embryos. Overall, our comparative analysis of GRN prediction methods defines a pipeline that can be applied to single-cell multi-omics datasets in especially challenging contexts to infer interactions between transcription factor expression and target gene regulation.
38022600 | High maternal-fetal HLA eplet compatibility is associated with severe manifestation of preeclampsia. Introduction: Preeclampsia is responsible for more than 70 000 and 500 000 maternal and fetal deaths, respectively each year. Incomplete remodelling of the spiral arteries in placenta is the most accepted theory of preeclampsia pathogenesis. However, the process is complexed with immunological background, as pregnancy resembles allograft transplantation. Fetus expresses human leukocyte antigens (HLA) inherited from both parents, thus is semiallogeneic to the maternal immune system. Therefore, induction of fetal tolerance is crucial for physiological outcome of pregnancy. Noteworthy, the immunogenicity of discordant HLA antigens is determined by functional epitopes called eplets, which are continuous and discontinuous short sequences of amino acids. This way various HLA molecules may express the same eplet and some HLA incompatibilities can be more immunogenic due to different eplet combination. Therefore, we hypothesized that maternal- fetal HLA incompatibility may be involved in the pathogenesis of gestational hypertension and its progression to preeclampsia. We also aimed to test if particular maternal-fetal eplet mismatches are more prone for induction of anti- fetal HLA antibodies in gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Methods: High resolution next-generation sequencing of HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1 antigens was performed in mothers and children from physiological pregnancies (12 pairs) and from pregnancies complicated with gestational hypertension (22 pairs) and preeclampsia (27 pairs). In the next step HLA eplet identification and analysis of HLA eplet incompatibilities was performed with in silico approach HLAMatchmaker algorithm. Simultaneously maternal sera were screened for anti-fetal HLA class I, class II and anti-MICA antibodies with Luminex, and data were analyzed with HLA-Fusion software. Results: We observed that high HLA-C, -B, and DQB1 maternal-fetal eplet compatibility was associated with severe preeclampsia (PE) manifestation. Both quantity and quality of HLA epletmismatches affected the severity of PE. Mismatches in HLA-B eplets: 65QIA+76ESN, 70IAO, 180E, HLA-C eplets: 193PL3, 267QE, and HLA-DRB1 eplet: 16Y were associated with a mild outcome of preeclampsia if the complication occurred. Conclusions: High HLA-C, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B eplet compatibility between mother and child is associated with severe manifestation of preeclampsia. Both quantity and quality of maternal-fetal HLA eplet mismatches affects severity of preeclampsia.
38072298 | Self-assembling amyloid-like nanostructures from SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, RBD and N recombinant proteins. Self-assembling nanoparticles (saNP) and nanofibers were found in the recombinant coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, RBD and N proteins purified by affinity chromatography using Ni Sepharose. Scanning electron (SEM), atomic force (AFM) microscopy on mica or graphite surface and in liquid as well as dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed nanostructures of various sizes. AFM in liquid cell without drying on the surface showed mean height of S1 saNP 80.03 nm, polydispersity index (PDI) 0.006; for S2 saNP mean height 93.32 nm, PDI = 0.008; for N saNP mean height 16.71 nm, PDI = 0.99; for RBD saNP mean height 16.25 nm, PDI = 0.55. Ratios between the height and radius of each saNP in the range 0.1-0.5 suggested solid protein NP but not vesicles with internal empty spaces. The solid but not empty structures of the protein saNP were also confirmed by STEM after treatment of saNP with the standard contrasting agent uranyl acetate. The saNP remained stable after multiple freeze-thaw cycles in water and hyperosmotic solutions for 2 years at -20  C. Receptor-mediated penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 and RBD saNP in the African green mokey kidney Vero cells with the specific receptors for beta-coronavirus reproduction was more efficient compared to unspecific endocytosis into MDCK cells without the specific receptors. Amyloid-like structures were revealed in the SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, RBD and N saNP by means of their interaction with Thioflavin T and Congo Red dyes. Taken together, spontaneous formation of the amyloid-like self-assembling nanostructures due to the internal affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 virion proteins might induce proteinopathy in patients, including conformational neurodegenerative diseases, change stability of vaccines and diagnostic systems.
18332098 | Sequencing-based genotyping and association analysis of the MICA and MICB genes in type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related molecules (MICs), encoded within the MHC, function in immunity. The transmembrane polymorphism in MICA (MICA-STR) has been reported to be associated with type 1 diabetes. In this study, we directly sequenced both of the highly polymorphic MIC genes (MICA and MICB) in order to establish whether they are associated with type 1 diabetes independently of the known type 1 diabetes MHC class II genes HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a sequencing-based typing method and genotyped MICA and MICB in 818 families (2,944 individuals) with type 1 diabetes from the U.K. and U.S. (constructing the genotype from single nucleotide polymorphisms in exons 2-4 of MICA and 2-5 of MICB) and additionally genotyped the MICA-STR in 2,023 type 1 diabetic case subjects and 1,748 control subjects from the U.K. We analyzed the association of the MICA and MICB alleles and genotypes with type 1 diabetes using regression methods. RESULTS: We identified known MICA and MICB alleles and discovered four new MICB alleles. Based on this large-scale and detailed genotype data, we found no evidence for association of MICA and MICB with type 1 diabetes independently of the MHC class II genes (MICA P = 0.08, MICA-STR P = 0.76, MICB P = 0.03, after conditioning on HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1). CONCLUSIONS: Common MICA and MICB genetic variations including the MICA-STR are not associated, in a primary way, with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.
22001756 | Genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for dengue shock syndrome at MICB and PLCE1. Hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome (DSS)) is the most common life-threatening complication of dengue. We conducted a genome-wide association study of 2,008 pediatric cases treated for DSS and 2,018 controls from Vietnam. Replication of the most significantly associated markers was carried out in an independent Vietnamese sample of 1,737 cases and 2,934 controls. SNPs at two loci showed genome-wide significant association with DSS. We identified a susceptibility locus at MICB (major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence B), which was within the broad MHC region on chromosome 6 but outside the class I and class II HLA loci (rs3132468, P(meta) = 4.41 x 10(-11), per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.34 (95% confidence interval: 1.23-1.46)). We identified associated variants within PLCE1 (phospholipase C, epsilon 1) on chromosome 10 (rs3765524, P(meta) = 3.08 x 10(-10), per-allele OR = 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.86)). We identify two loci associated with susceptibility to DSS in people with dengue, suggesting possible mechanisms for this severe complication of dengue.
22914738 | Conditional analysis identifies three novel major histocompatibility complex loci associated with psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder. A number of genetic loci have been shown to confer risk for psoriasis. Collectively, these offer an integrated model for the inherited basis for susceptibility to psoriasis that combines altered skin barrier function together with the dysregulation of innate immune pathogen sensing and adap-tive immunity. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) harbours the psoriasis susceptibility region which exhibits the largest effect size, driven in part by variation contained on the HLA-Cw*0602 allele. However, the resolution of the number and genomic location of potential independent risk loci are hampered by extensive linkage disequilibrium across the region. We leveraged the power of large psoriasis case and control data sets and the statistical approach of conditional analysis to identify potential further association signals distributed across the MHC. In addition to the major loci at HLA-C (P = 2.20 x 10(-236)), we observed and replicated four additional independent signals for disease association, three of which are novel. We detected evidence for association at SNPs rs2507971 (P = 6.73 x 10(-14)), rs9260313 (P = 7.93 x 10(-09)), rs66609536 (P = 3.54 x 10(-07)) and rs380924 (P = 6.24 x 10(-06)), located within the class I region of the MHC, with each observation replicated in an independent sample (P <= 0.01). The previously identified locus is close to MICA, the other three lie near MICB, HLA-A and HCG9 (a non-coding RNA gene). The identification of disease associations with both MICA and MICB is particularly intriguing, since each encodes an MHC class I-related protein with potent immunological function.
24600518 | The Region Centromeric to HLA-C Is a Key Region for Understanding the Phenotypic Variability of Psoriatic Arthritis. With the aim of clarifying the role of several polymorphisms around the HLA-C locus in the clinical expression of PsA, the distribution of several polymorphic markers and genes located around the HLA-C locus was analyzed in a well-established cohort of 110 patients with PsA, 50 patients with psoriasis alone, and 110 healthy controls. The frequency of these genes was also analyzed by PsA articular models, based on three main subgroups: oligoarthritis, polyarthritis, and spondylitis. Distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) involvement was associated with the presence of MICB-CA20 (OR 6.0, 95% CI: 1.58-22.69, P = 0.005). HLA-DRB*07 was associated with oligoarticular forms of PsA (OR 4.1, 95% CI: 1.8-9.3, P = 0.0007). The spondylitic forms overexpressed the antigen HLA-B*27 (OR 5.7, 95% CI: 2.4-13.6, P = 0.0001). MICA-A5.1 showed association with polyarthritis (OR 3.7, 95% CI: 1.5-8.8, P = 0.006). Genes telomeric to HLA-C were overexpressed in psoriasis but not in PsA subphenotypes. This study shows that the region centromeric to HLA-C is a key region that expresses not only disease risk genes but also genes that help explain the phenotypic variability of PsA. 
24939907 | Evidence after imputation for a role of MICA variants in nonprogression and elite control of HIV type 1 infection. Past genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving individuals with AIDS have mainly identified associations in the HLA region. Using the latest software, we imputed 7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/indels of the 1000 Genomes Project from the GWAS-determined genotypes of individuals in the Genomics of Resistance to Immunodeficiency Virus AIDS nonprogression cohort and compared them with those of control cohorts. The strongest signals were in MICA, the gene encoding major histocompatibility class I polypeptide-related sequence A (P = 3.31 x 10(-12)), with a particular exonic deletion (P = 1.59 x 10(-8)) in full linkage disequilibrium with the reference HCP5 rs2395029 SNP. Haplotype analysis also revealed an additive effect between HLA-C, HLA-B, and MICA variants. These data suggest a role for MICA in progression and elite control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection. 
25087609 | Fine mapping major histocompatibility complex associations in psoriasis and its clinical subtypes. Psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) risk is strongly associated with variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, but its genetic architecture has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we conducted a large-scale fine-mapping study of PsV risk in the MHC region in 9,247 PsV-affected individuals and 13,589 controls of European descent by imputing class I and II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes from SNP genotype data. In addition, we imputed sequence variants for MICA, an MHC HLA-like gene that has been associated with PsV, to evaluate association at that locus as well. We observed that HLA-C(*)06:02 demonstrated the lowest p value for overall PsV risk (p = 1.7 x 10(-364)). Stepwise analysis revealed multiple HLA-C(*)06:02-independent risk variants in both class I and class II HLA genes for PsV susceptibility (HLA-C(*)12:03, HLA-B amino acid positions 67 and 9, HLA-A amino acid position 95, and HLA-DQalpha1 amino acid position 53; p < 5.0 x 10(-8)), but no apparent risk conferred by MICA. We further evaluated risk of two major clinical subtypes of PsV, psoriatic arthritis (PsA; n = 3,038) and cutaneous psoriasis (PsC; n = 3,098). We found that risk heterogeneity between PsA and PsC might be driven by HLA-B amino acid position 45 (Pomnibus = 2.2 x 10(-11)), indicating that different genetic factors underlie the overall risk of PsV and the risk of specific PsV subphenotypes. Our study illustrates the value of high-resolution HLA and MICA imputation for fine mapping causal variants in the MHC.
25220211 | CD8alphaalpha+ innate-type lymphocytes in the intestinal epithelium mediate mucosal immunity. Innate immune responses are critical for mucosal immunity. Here we describe an innate lymphocyte population, iCD8alpha cells, characterized by expression of CD8alpha homodimers. iCD8alpha cells exhibit innate functional characteristics such as the capacity to engulf and kill bacteria. Development of iCD8alpha cells depends on expression of interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain (IL-2Rgammac), IL-15, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib protein H2-T3, also known as the thymus leukemia antigen or TL. While lineage tracking experiments indicated that iCD8alpha cells have a lymphoid origin, their development was independent of the transcriptional suppressor Id2, suggesting that these cells do not belong to the family of innate lymphoid cells. Finally, we identified cells with a similar phenotype in humans, which were profoundly depleted in newborns with necrotizing enterocolitis. These findings suggest a critical role of iCD8alpha cells in immune responses associated with the intestinal epithelium. 
25521205 | Refinement of the MHC risk map in a scandinavian primary sclerosing cholangitis population. BACKGROUND: Genetic variants within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represent the strongest genetic susceptibility factors for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Identifying the causal variants within this genetic complex represents a major challenge due to strong linkage disequilibrium and an overall high physical density of candidate variants. We aimed to refine the MHC association in a geographically restricted PSC patient panel. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 365 PSC cases and 368 healthy controls of Scandinavian ancestry were included in the study. We incorporated data from HLA typing (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB3, -DRB1, -DQB1) and single nucleotide polymorphisms across the MHC (n = 18,644; genotyped and imputed) alongside previously suggested PSC risk determinants in the MHC, i.e. amino acid variation of DRbeta, a MICA microsatellite polymorphism and HLA-C and HLA-B according to their ligand properties for killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. Breakdowns of the association signal by unconditional and conditional logistic regression analyses demarcated multiple PSC associated MHC haplotypes, and for eight of these classical HLA class I and II alleles represented the strongest association. A novel independent risk locus was detected near NOTCH4 in the HLA class III region, tagged by rs116212904 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 2.32 [1.80, 3.00], P = 1.35x10-11). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study shows that classical HLA class I and II alleles, predominantly at HLA-B and HLA-DRB1, are the main risk factors for PSC in the MHC. In addition, the present assessments demonstrated for the first time an association near NOTCH4 in the HLA class III region.
26148331 | The expression of B & T cell activation markers in children's tonsils following live attenuated influenza vaccine. Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) can prevent influenza illness and death in children. The absence of known correlates of protection induced by LAIV requires human studies of underlying mechanisms of vaccine-induced immunity, to further elucidate the immunological processes occurring. In this study, children scheduled for elective tonsillectomy were enrolled in a clinical trial to evaluate the immune response to LAIV, in order to compare T and B cell gene expression profiles. Twenty-three children (aged 3-17 years) were divided into 4 groups; unvaccinated controls, or vaccinated intranasally with LAIV at days 3-4, 6-7, and 12-15 before tonsillectomy. Total RNA extraction was performed on tonsillar tissue and high RNA quality was assured. The samples were then analyzed using a validated RT2 Profiler PCR Array containing 84 gene-specific primers involved in B and T cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, regulation and polarization. The gene expression after LAIV vaccination was subsequently compared to the controls. We observed that at d 3-4 post vaccination, 6 genes were down-regulated, namely APC, CD3G, FASLG, IL7, CD8A and TLR1. Meanwhile at 6-7 days post vaccination, 9 genes were significantly up-regulated, including RIPK2, TGFB1, MICB, SOCS1, IL2RA, MS4A1, PTPRC, IL2 and IL8. By days 12-15 the genes RIPK2, IL4, IL12B and TLR2 were overexpressed. RIPK2 was upregulated at all 3 time points. Our data suggests an overall proliferation, differentiation and regulation of B and T cells in the tonsils following LAIV, where the majority of genes were up-regulated at days 6-7 and normalized by days 12-15. These findings may provide a first step into defining future biomarkers or correlates of protection after LAIV immunization.
26511765 | Prediction of microcephaly at birth using three reference ranges for fetal head circumference: can we improve prenatal diagnosis? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prediction of microcephaly at birth (micB) using established and two new reference ranges for fetal head circumference (HC) and to assess whether integrating additional parameters can improve prediction. METHODS: Microcephaly in utero was defined as a fetal HC 3SD below the mean for gestational age according to Jeanty et al.'s reference range. The records of cases with fetal microcephaly (Fmic) were evaluated for medical history, imaging findings, biometry and postnatal examination/autopsy findings. Microcephaly was confirmed at birth (micB) by an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) or a brain weight at autopsy 2SD below the mean for gestational age. The new INTERGROWTH-21(st) Project and a recent Israeli reference for fetal growth were applied for evaluation of the Fmic positive predictive value (PPV) for diagnosis of micB cases. Optimal HC cut-offs were determined for each of the new references with the aim of detecting all micB cases whilst minimizing the number of false positives found to have a normal HC at birth. We also assessed the difference between the Z-scores of the prenatal HC and the corresponding OFC at birth, the frequency of small-for-gestational age (SGA), decreased HC/abdominal circumference (AC) and HC/femur length (FL) ratios, the prevalence of associated malformations and family history. RESULTS: Forty-two fetuses were diagnosed as having Fmic according to the Jeanty reference, but micB was confirmed in only 24 (PPV, 57.1%). The optimal INTERGROWTH and Israeli reference HC cut-offs for micB diagnosis were mean - 3SD and mean - 2.3SD, resulting in a statistically non-significant improvement in PPV to 61.5% and 66.7%, respectively. The presence of a family history of microcephaly, SGA, associated malformations and application of stricter HC cut-offs resulted in a higher PPV of micB, although not statistically significant and with a concurrent increase in the number of false-negative results. The deviation of the HC from the mean, by all references, was significantly larger compared with the actual deviation of the OFC at birth, with mean differences between the corresponding Z-scores of -1.15, -1.95 and -0.74 for the Jeanty, INTERGROWTH and Israeli references, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated reference ranges all result in considerable over-diagnosis of fetal microcephaly. The use of the two new HC reference ranges did not significantly improve micB prediction compared with that of Jeanty et al., whilst use of additional characteristics and stricter HC cut-offs could improve the PPV with an increase in false negatives. The postnatal OFC deviates significantly less from the mean compared with the prenatal HC, and we propose that adjustment for this would enable better prediction of the actual OFC deviation at birth.

26569110 | MICB Allele Genotyping on Microarrays by Improving the Specificity of Extension Primers. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene B (MICB) encodes a ligand for activating NKG2D that expressed in natural killer cells, gammadelta T cells, and alphabeta CD8+ T cells, which is associated with autoimmune diseases, cancer, and infectious diseases. Here, we have established a system for genotyping MICB alleles using allele-specific primer extension (ASPE) on microarrays. Thirty-six high quality, allele-specific extension primers were evaluated using strict and reliable cut-off values using mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), whereby an MFI >30,000 represented a positive signal and an MFI <10,000 represented a negative signal. Eight allele-specific extension primers were found to be false positives, five of which were improved by adjusting their length, and three of which were optimized by refractory modification. The MICB alleles (*002:01, *003, *005:02/*010, *005:03, *008, *009N, *018, and *024) present in the quality control panel could be exactly defined by 22 allele-specific extension primers. MICB genotypes that were identified by ASPE on microarrays were in full concordance with those identified by PCR-sequence-based typing. In conclusion, we have developed a method for genotyping MICB alleles using ASPE on microarrays; which can be applicable for large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism typing studies of population and disease associations. 
26613086 | Polymorphisms Associated with Age at Onset in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease in which genetics play a major role. Although many genome-wide association studies have been performed in psoriasis, knowledge of the age at onset remains limited. Therefore, we analyzed 173 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes associated with psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis type I (early-onset, <40 years) or type II (late-onset, >=40 years) and healthy controls. Moreover, we performed a comparison between patients with type I psoriasis and patients with type II psoriasis. Our comparison of a stratified population with type I psoriasis (n = 155) and healthy controls (N = 197) is the first to reveal a relationship between the CLMN, FBXL19, CCL4L, C17orf51, TYK2, IL13, SLC22A4, CDKAL1, and HLA-B/MICA genes. When we compared type I psoriasis with type II psoriasis (N = 36), we found a significant association between age at onset and the genes PSORS6, TNF-alpha, FCGR2A, TNFR1, CD226, HLA-C, TNFAIP3, and CCHCR1. Moreover, we replicated the association between rs12191877 (HLA-C) and type I psoriasis and between type I and type II psoriasis. Our findings highlight the role of genetics in age of onset of psoriasis. 
26672749 | MHC Class I Chain-Related Gene A Polymorphisms and Linkage Disequilibrium with HLA-B and HLA-C Alleles in Ocular Toxoplasmosis. This study investigated whether polymorphisms of the MICA (major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A) gene are associated with eye lesions due to Toxoplasma gondii infection in a group of immunocompetent patients from southeastern Brazil. The study enrolled 297 patients with serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. Participants were classified into two distinct groups after conducting fundoscopic exams according to the presence (n = 148) or absence (n = 149) of ocular scars/lesions due to toxoplasmosis. The group of patients with scars/lesions was further subdivided into two groups according to the type of the ocular manifestation observed: primary (n = 120) or recurrent (n = 28). Genotyping of the MICA and HLA alleles was performed by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide technique (PCR-SSO; One Lambda ) and the MICA-129 polymorphism (rs1051792) was identified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP). Significant associations involving MICA polymorphisms were not found. Although the MICA*002~HLA-B*35 haplotype was associated with increased risk of developing ocular toxoplasmosis (P-value = 0.04; OR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.05-4.60), and the MICA*008~HLA-C*07 haplotype was associated with protection against the development of manifestations of ocular toxoplasmosis (P-value = 0.009; OR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.22-0.76), these associations were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. MICA polymorphisms do not appear to influence the development of ocular lesions in patients diagnosed with toxoplasmosis in this study population. 
26916564 | Application of a novel prenatal vertical cranial biometric measurement can improve accuracy of microcephaly diagnosis in utero. OBJECTIVE: To construct a reference range for a new vertical measurement of the fetal head and to assess whether its combination with fetal head circumference (HC) can prevent the misdiagnosis of microcephaly in fetuses with an acrocephalic-like head deformation. METHODS: A new vertical cranial biometric measurement was defined: the foramen magnum-to-cranium distance (FCD), measured between the foramen magnum and the upper inner cranial border along the posterior wall of the brainstem. The measurement was performed in a precise mid-sagittal plane using a three-dimensional multiplanar display of a sagittally acquired sonographic volume of the fetal head. The normal reference range was developed by measuring 396 healthy fetuses of low-risk singleton pregnancies between 15 and 40 gestational weeks. This reference was applied to 25 fetuses with microcephaly diagnosed prenatally (Fmic) based on HC >= 3 SD below the mean for gestational age. We determined an optimal FCD cut-off for combination with HC to detect all cases found with microcephaly at birth (micB), while excluding the fetuses with normal head circumference at birth (NHCB), who were described postnatally as having an acrocephalic-like cranial deformation. RESULTS: In the healthy singleton fetuses, FCD increased with gestational age, with a quadratic equation providing an optimal fit to the data (adjusted R(2) = 0.934). The measurement could be assessed in 95.2% of cases. Of the 25 cases diagnosed with Fmic prenatally, on the basis of HC alone, 14 were micB and 11 were NHCB. We observed FCD below the mean - 2SD for gestational age in all 14 micB cases, but in only four of the 11 NHCB cases (P < 0.003). An acrocephalic-like cranial deformation was described at birth in five of the seven NHCB cases with normal FCD. The mean +- SD FCD Z-score of the micB cases was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than that of the false-positive ones: -3.85 +- 0.96 SD and -1.59 +- 1.45 SD, respectively. Based on HC measurement alone, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 56%. Combination of the HC and FCD criteria raised the PPV to 78%, decreasing the number of false positives from 11 to four, without missing any of the 14 micB cases. CONCLUSIONS: Fetal vertical cranial biometric assessment in the mid-sagittal plane is feasible and correlates well with gestational age. In our series, a vertical cranial deformation was a frequent cause of a false Fmic diagnosis made on the basis of HC alone. Combination of the new vertical cranial biometric measurement with HC measurement can exclude these cases and thus improve diagnostic accuracy for Fmic. Copyright   2016 ISUOG.

27057306 | Host nucleotide polymorphism in hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is etiologically linked with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is the leading cause of death amongst 80% of HBV patients. Among HBV affected patients, genetic factors are also involved in modifying the risk factors of HCC. However, the genetic factors that regulate progression to HCC still remain to be determined. In this review, we discuss several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which were reportedly associated with increased or reduced risk of HCC occurrence in patients with chronic HBV infection such as cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression specifically at COX-2 -1195G/A in Chinese, Turkish and Egyptian populations, tumor necrosis factor alpha and the three most commonly studied SNPs: PAT-/+, Lys939Gln (A33512C, rs2228001) and Ala499Val (C21151T, rs2228000). In genome-wide association studies, strong associations have also been found at loci 1p36.22, 11q22.3, 6p21 (rs1419881, rs3997872, rs7453920 and rs7768538), 8p12 (rs2275959 and rs37821974) and 22q11.21. The genes implicated in these studies include HLA-DQB2, HLA-DQA1, TCF19, HLA-C, UBE2L3, LTL, FDX1, MICA, UBE4B and PG. The SNPs found to be associated with the above-mentioned genes still require validation in association studies in order to be considered good prognostic candidates for HCC. Screening of these polymorphisms is very beneficial in clinical experiments to stratify the higher or lower risk for HCC and may help in designing effective and efficient HCC surveillance programs for chronic HBV-infected patients if further genetic vulnerabilities are detected. 
27141379 | Overexpression of KIR inhibitory ligands (HLA-I) determines that immunosurveillance of myeloma depends on diverse and strong NK cell licensing. Missing self recognition makes cancer sensitive to natural killer cell (NKc) reactivity. However, this model disregards the NKc licensing effect, which highly increases NKc reactivity through interactions of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIR) with their cognate HLA-I ligands. The influence of iKIR/HLA-ligand (HLA-C1/C2) licensing interactions on the susceptibility to and progression of plasma cell (PC) dyscrasias was evaluated in 164 Caucasian patients and 286 controls. Compared to controls, myeloma accumulates KIR2DL1-L2+L3- genotypes (2.8% vs. 13.2%, p < 0.01, OR = 5.29) and less diverse peripheral repertoires of NKc clones. Less diverse and weaker-affinity repertoires of iKIR2D/HLA-C licensing interactions increased myeloma susceptibility. Thus, the complete absence of conventional iKIR2D/HLA-C licensing interactions (KIR2DL1-L2+L3-/C2C2, 2.56% vs. 0.35%; p < 0.05; OR = 15.014), single-KIR2DL3+/C1+ (20.51% vs. 10.84%; p < 0.05; OR = 2.795) and single-KIR2DL2+/C1+ (12.82% vs. 4.9%; p < 0.01; OR = 5.18) interactions were over-represented in myeloma, compared to controls. Additionally, KIR2DL1-L2+L3- (20% vs. 83%, p < 0.00001) as well as KIR3DL1- (23% vs. 82%, p < 0.00001) genotypes had a dramatic negative impact on the 3-y progression-free survival (PFS), particularly in patients with low-tumor burden. Remarkably, myeloma-PCs, compared to K562 and other hematological cancers, showed substantial over-expression of HLA-I (\increasing-self\ instead of missing-self), including HLA-C, and mild expression of ligands for NKc activating receptors (aRec) CD112, CD155, ULBP-1 and MICA/B, which apparently renders myeloma-PCs susceptible to lysis mainly by licensed NKc. KIR2DL1-L2+L3-/C2C2 patients (with no conventional iKIR2D/HLA-C licensing interactions) lyse K562 but barely lyse myeloma-PCs (4% vs. 15%; p < 0.05, compared to controls). These results support a model where immunosurveillance of no-missing-self cancers, e.g., myeloma, mainly depends on NKc licensing.
28256194 | Polymorphic Variations Associated With Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer Patients. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a commonly used antineoplastic agent for the treatment of various malignancies, and its use is associated with unpredictable cardiotoxicity. Susceptibility to DOX cardiotoxicity is largely patient dependent, suggesting genetic predisposition. We have previously found that individual sensitivity to DOX cardiotoxicity was associated with differential expression of genes implicated in inflammatory response and immune trafficking, which was consistent with the increasing number of reports highlighting the important role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex polymorphism in hypersensitivity to drug toxicity. This pilot study aimed to investigate DNA from patients treated with DOX-based chemotherapy for breast cancer and to correlate the results with the risk for DOX-associated cardiotoxicity. We have identified 18 SNPs in nine genes in the HLA region (NFKBIL1, TNF-alpha, ATP6V1G2-DDX39B, MSH5, MICA, LTA, BAT1, and NOTCH4) and in the psoriasis susceptibility region of HLA-C as potential candidates for association with DOX cardiotoxicity. These results, albeit preliminary and involving a small number of patients, are consistent with reports showing the presence of susceptibility loci within the HLA gene region for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and with our previous findings indicating that the increased sensitivity to DOX cardiotoxicity was associated with dysregulation of genes implicated both in inflammation and autoimmune disorders.
28578917 | STAT3 inhibition by STA21 increases cell surface expression of MICB and the release of soluble MICB by gastric adenocarcinoma cells. NKG2D is an activating receptor expressed on NK cells that binds to a variety of ligands, including MICA and MICB. These cell surface glycoproteins are overexpressed under cellular transformation, thus playing an important role in cell-mediated immune response to tumors. STAT3 is a transcription factor that is constitutively active in cancer. It negatively regulates MICA expression on target cells, while its inhibition enhances NK cell cytotoxicity against tumors. In this work, we aimed to describe the effect of STAT3 signaling inhibition by STA21 on the regulation of MICB expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells and its effect on the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma cells with STA21 induced an increase in MICB expression and soluble MICB secretion, as well as a variable pattern on effector cell degranulation. Soluble MICB secretion by gastric adenocarcinoma cells was not affected by metalloprotease inhibition. We also observed that primary gastric adenocarcinoma tissue released soluble MICB into the extracellular milieu. Recombinant MICB induced a significant decrease in the levels of NKG2D receptor on effector NK and CD8+ T cells, which correlated with an impaired cytotoxic function. Altogether, our data provide evidence that STAT3 signaling pathway regulates MICB expression on gastric adenocarcinoma cells and that recombinant soluble MICB compromises the cytolytic activity of NK cells.
28599625 | Genetic variants of MICB and PLCE1 and associations with the laboratory features of dengue. BACKGROUND: A previous genome-wide association study identified 2 susceptibility loci for severe dengue at MICB rs3132468 and PLCE1 rs3740360 and further work showed these mutations to be also associated with less severe clinical presentations. The aim of this study was to determine if these specific loci were associated with laboratory features of dengue that correlate with clinical severity with the aim of elucidating the functional basis of these genetic variants. METHODS: This was a case-only analysis of laboratory-confirmed dengue patients obtained from 2 prospective cohort studies and 1 randomised clinical trial in Vietnam (Trial registration: ISRCTN ISRCTN03147572. Registered 24th July 2012). 2742 dengue cases were successfully genotyped at MICB rs3132468 and PLCE1 rs3740360. Laboratory variables were compared between genotypes and stratified by DENV serotype. RESULTS: The analysis showed no association between MICB and PLCE1 genotype and early viraemia level, platelet nadir, white cell count nadir, or maximum haematocrit in both overall analysis and in analysis stratified by serotype. DISCUSSION: The lack of an association between genotype and viremia level may reflect the sampling procedures within the included studies. The study findings mean that the functional basis of these mutations remains unclear. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN03147572 . Registered 24th July 2012.
28617847 | The association between 38 previously reported polymorphisms and psoriasis in a Polish population: High predicative accuracy of a genetic risk score combining 16 loci. OBJECTIVES: To confirm the association of previously discovered psoriasis (Ps) risk loci with the disease in a Polish population and to create predictive models based on the combination of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-eight SNPs were genotyped in 480 Ps patients and 490 controls. Alleles distributions were compared between patients and controls, as well as between different Ps sub-phenotypes. The genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated to assess the cumulative risk conferred by multiple loci. RESULTS: We confirmed associations of several loci with Ps: HLA-C, REL, IL12B, TRIM39/RPP21, POU5F1, MICA. The analysis of ROC curves showed that GRS combining 16 SNPs at least nominally (uncorrected P<0.05) associated with Ps (GRS-N) had significantly better discriminative power than GRS combining SNPs associated with Ps after the Bonferroni correction (AUC 0.776 vs. 0.750, P = 1 x 10-4) or HLA-C (AUC 0.776 vs. 0.694, P<1 x 10-5). On the other hand, adding additional SNPs to the model did not improve its discriminatory ability (AUC 0.782 for GRS combining all SNPs, P>0.05). In order to assess the total risk conferred by GRS-N, we calculated ORs according to GRS-N quartile - the Ps OR for top vs. bottom GRS-N quartiles was 12.29 (P<1 x 10-6). The analysis of different Ps sub-phenotypes showed an association of GRS-N with age of onset and family history of Ps. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the association of Ps with several previously identified genetic risk factors in a Polish population. We found that a GRS combining 16 SNPs at least nominally associated with Ps had a significantly better discriminatory ability than HLA-C or GRS combining SNPs associated with Ps after the Bonferroni correction. In contrast, adding additional SNPs to GRS did not increase significantly the discriminative power.
28684217 | NKG2D ligand expression in Crohn's disease and NKG2D-dependent stimulation of CD8+ T cell migration. Interaction between the activating NKG2D receptor on lymphocytes and its ligands MICA, MICB, and ULBP1-6 modulate T and NK cell activity and may contribute to the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD). NKG2D ligands are generally not expressed on the cell surface of normal, non-stressed cells, but expression of MICA and MICB in CD intestine has been reported. In this exploratory study, we further characterize the expression of NKG2D and its ligands, including the less well-described ULBP4-6, in CD, and test if NKG2D ligand interactions are involved in the migration of activated T cells into the affected mucosal compartments. Intestinal tissue from CD patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and immunohistochemistry for expression of NKG2D and ligands, and for cytokine release. Furthermore, NKG2D-dependent chemotaxis of activated CD8+ T cells across a monolayer of ligand-expressing human intestinal endothelial cells was examined. Activated lymphocytes down-regulated NKG2D expression upon accumulation in inflamed CD intestine. NKG2D expression on CD56+ T and gammadelta T cells from inflamed tissue seemed inversely correlated with CRP levels and cytokine release. B cells, monocytes, mucosal epithelium, and vascular endothelium expressed NKG2D ligands in inflamed CD intestine. The expression of NKG2D ligands was correlated with cytokine release, but was highly variable between patients. Stimulation of vascular intestinal endothelial cells in vitro induced expression of NKG2D ligands, including MICA/B and ULBP2/6. Blockade of NKG2D on CD8+ T cells inhibited the migration over ligand-expressing endothelial cells. Intestinal induction of NKG2D ligands and ligand-induced down-regulation of NKG2D in CD suggest that the NKG2D-ligand interaction may be involved in both the activation and recruitment of NKG2D+ lymphocytes into the inflamed CD intestine.
28855716 | A genome-wide association analysis identifies NMNAT2 and HCP5 as susceptibility loci for Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease (KD), a systemic vasculitis of infants and children, manifests as fever and mucocutaneous inflammation. Although its etiology is largely unknown, the epidemiological data suggest that genetic factors are important in KD susceptibility. To identify genetic variants influencing KD susceptibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication study using a total of 915 children with KD and 4553 controls in the Korean population. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three loci were associated significantly with KD susceptibility (P<1.0 x 10-5), including the previously reported BLK locus (rs6993775, odds ratio (OR)=1.52, P=2.52 x 10-11). The other two loci were newly identified: NMNAT2 on chromosome 1q25.3 (rs2078087, OR=1.33, P=1.15 x 10-6) and the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6p21.3 (HLA-C, HLA-B, MICA and HCP5) (rs9380242, rs9378199, rs9266669 and rs6938467; OR=1.33-1.51, P=8.93 x 10-6 to 5.24 x 10-8). Additionally, SNP rs17280682 in NLRP14 was associated significantly with KD with a family history (18 cases vs 4553 controls, OR=6.76, P=5.46 x 10-6). These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of KD.
28926962 | Anti-NKG2D mAb: A New Treatment for Crohn's Disease? Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are immunologically-mediated, debilitating conditions resulting from destructive inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of IBD is incompletely understood, but is considered to be the result of an abnormal immune response with a wide range of cell types and proteins involved. Natural Killer Group 2D (NKG2D) is an activating receptor constitutively expressed on human Natural Killer (NK), gammadelta T, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), CD56+ T, and CD8+ T cells. Activation of NKG2D triggers cellular proliferation, cytokine production, and target cell killing. Research into the NKG2D mechanism of action has primarily been focused on cancer and viral infections where cytotoxicity evasion is a concern. In human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) this system is less characterized, but the ligands have been shown to be highly expressed during intestinal inflammation and the following receptor activation may contribute to tissue degeneration. A recent phase II clinical trial showed that an antibody against NKG2D induced clinical remission of CD in some patients, suggesting NKG2D and its ligands to be of importance in the pathogenesis of CD. This review will describe the receptor and its ligands in intestinal tissues and the clinical potential of blocking NKG2D in Crohn's disease.
29929468 | Identification of genetic variants associated with dengue or West Nile virus disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis. BACKGROUND: Dengue and West Nile viruses are highly cross-reactive and have numerous parallels in geography, potential vector host (Aedes family of mosquitoes), and initial symptoms of infection. While the vast majority (> 80%) of both dengue and West Nile virus infections result in asymptomatic infections, a minority of individuals experience symptomatic infection and an even smaller proportion develop severe disease. The mechanisms by which these infections lead to severe disease in a subset of infected individuals is incompletely understood, but individual host differences including genetic factors and immune responses have been proposed. We sought to identify genetic risk factors that are associated with more severe disease outcomes for both viruses in order to shed light on possible shared mechanisms of resistance and potential therapeutic interventions. METHODS: We applied a search strategy using four major databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Global Health) to find all known genetic associations identified to date with dengue or West Nile virus disease. Here we present a review of our findings and a meta-analysis of genetic variants identified. RESULTS: We found genetic variations that are significantly associated with infections of these viruses. In particular we found variation within the OAS1 (meta-OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.69-1.00) and CCR5 (meta-OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.08-1.53) genes is significantly associated with West Nile virus disease, while variation within MICB (meta-OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.68-3.29), PLCE1 (meta-OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.42-0.71), MBL2 (meta-OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.31), and IFN-gamma (meta-OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.30-4.71), is associated with dengue disease. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial heterogeneity in populations studied, genes examined, and methodology, significant associations with genetic variants were found across studies within both diseases. These gene associations suggest a key role for immune mechanisms in susceptibility to severe disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis and may reveal additional genetic factors associated with disease severity.
29970280 | Diagnostic approach to fetal microcephaly. Microcephaly in utero is conventionally defined as a fetal head circumference (HC) 3SD below the mean for gestational age according to Jeanty et al.'s reference range. Prediction of microcephaly at birth (micB) based on conventional prenatal biometry is associated with a high percentage of false positive diagnoses and as a result, in countries in which it is an option, termination of pregnancy may be offered in cases that would have culminated in birth of a normocephalic child. A false negative diagnosis is rarer, but may lead to the birth of a symptomatic microcephalic child. In this review we present the results of our recent studies aimed at improvement of accurate prenatal detection of microcephaly including: (1), application of two new reference ranges for fetal HC in cases with a prenatal diagnosis of microcephaly based on the conventional reference; (2) assessment whether integration of additional parameters (stricter fetal HC cut-offs, small-for-gestational age (SGA), decreased HC/abdominal circumference and HC/femur length ratios, presence of associated malformations and family history) can improve prediction; (3), estimation of the difference between Z-scores of prenatal HC and the corresponding occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) at birth in order to propose an adjustment for better prediction of the actual OFC deviation at birth; (4), assessment whether micB diagnosis can be improved by accurate detection of false positive Fmic cases whose small HC is due to an acrocephalic-like head deformation by applying a new reference range of a vertical measurement of the fetal head: foramen magnum-to-cranium distance (FCD). The conventional and new reference ranges for fetal HC, all result in considerable over-diagnosis of fetal microcephaly (ranging from 43% to 33%). The use of the new references does not significantly improve micB prediction compared with the conventional one, whilst integrating additional parameters results in a better positive predictive value (PPV), but an increase in false negatives. The degree of Fmic severity is significantly over-estimated compared to the corresponding micB. The difference between the postnatal OFC deviation from the mean and the prenatal HC ranges from -0.74 SD to -1.95 SD for various fetal HC references. Application of the reference range for vertical cranial dimensions enables exclusion of fetuses with a small HC associated with a vertical cranial deformity without missing those with actual micB. Combining the fetal HC with the developed FCD criteria raised the PPV of micB to 78%. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of micB can be improved by integrating additional parameters and by application of the FCD criteria, however the correct diagnosis of Fmic remains challenging. An algorithm for evaluation of fetal microcephaly is provided.
30180944 | Manufacturing development and clinical production of NKG2D chimeric antigen receptor-expressing T cells for autologous adoptive cell therapy. BACKGROUND AIMS: Adoptive cell therapy employing natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in several model systems, including hematological and solid tumors. We present comprehensive data on manufacturing development and clinical production of autologous NKG2D CAR T cells for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02203825). An NKG2D CAR was generated by fusing native full-length human NKG2D to the human CD3zeta cytoplasmic signaling domain. NKG2D naturally associates with native costimulatory molecule DAP10, effectively generating a second-generation CAR against multiple ligands upregulated during malignant transformation including MIC-A, MIC-B and the UL-16 binding proteins. METHODS: CAR T cells were infused fresh after a 9-day process wherein OKT3-activated T cells were genetically modified with replication-defective gamma-retroviral vector and expanded ex vivo for 5 days with recombinant human interleukin-2. RESULTS: Despite sizable interpatient variation in originally collected cells, release criteria, including T-cell expansion and purity (median 98%), T-cell transduction (median 66% CD8+ T cells), and functional activity against NKG2D ligand-positive cells, were met for 100% of healthy donors and patients enrolled and collected. There was minimal carryover of non-T cells, particularly malignant cells; both effector memory and central memory cells were generated, and inflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, RANTES, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were selectively up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: The process resulted in production of required cell doses for the first-in-human phase I NKG2D CAR T clinical trial and provides a robust, flexible base for further optimization of NKG2D CAR T-cell manufacturing.
30307368 | High-resolution glycosylation site-engineering method identifies MICA epitope critical for shedding inhibition activity of anti-MICA antibodies. As an immune evasion strategy, MICA and MICB, the major histocompatibility complex class I homologs, are proteolytically cleaved from the surface of cancer cells leading to impairment of CD8 + T cell- and natural killer cell-mediated immune responses. Antibodies that inhibit MICA/B shedding from tumors have therapeutic potential, but the optimal epitopes are unknown. Therefore, we developed a high-resolution, high-throughput glycosylation-engineered epitope mapping (GEM) method, which utilizes site-specific insertion of N-linked glycans onto the antigen surface to mask local regions. We apply GEM to the discovery of epitopes important for shedding inhibition of MICA/B and validate the epitopes at the residue level by alanine scanning and X-ray crystallography (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 6DDM (1D5 Fab-MICA*008), 6DDR (13A9 Fab-MICA*008), 6DDV (6E1 Fab-MICA*008). Furthermore, we show that potent inhibition of MICA shedding can be achieved by antibodies that bind GEM epitopes adjacent to previously reported cleavage sites, and that these anti-MICA/B antibodies can prevent tumor growth in vivo.
30871626 | Cocultures of human colorectal tumor spheroids with immune cells reveal the therapeutic potential of MICA/B and NKG2A targeting for cancer treatment. BACKGROUND: Immunotherapies still fail to benefit colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Relevant functional assays aimed at studying these failures and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in human are scarce. 3D tumor cultures, called tumor organoids or spheroids, represent interesting models to study cancer treatments and could help to challenge these issues. METHODS: We analyzed heterotypic cocultures of human colon tumor-derived spheroids with immune cells to assess the infiltration, activation and function of T and NK cells toward human colorectal tumors in vitro. RESULTS: We showed that allogeneic T and NK cells rapidly infiltrated cell line-derived spheroids, inducing immune-mediated tumor cell apoptosis and spheroid destruction. NKG2D, a key activator of cytotoxic responses, was engaged on infiltrating cells. We thus assessed the therapeutic potential of an antibody targeting the specific ligands of NKG2D, MICA and MICB, in this system. Anti-MICA/B enhanced immune-dependent destruction of tumor spheroid by driving an increased NK cells infiltration and activation. Interestingly, tumor cells reacted to immune infiltration by upregulating HLA-E, ligand of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A expressed by CD8 and NK cells. NKG2A was increased after anti-MICA/B treatment and, accordingly, combination of anti-MICA/B and anti-NKG2A was synergistic. These observations were ultimately confirmed in a clinical relevant model of coculture between CRC patients-derived spheroids and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, we show that tumor spheroids represent a relevant tool to study tumor-lymphocyte interactions on human tissues and revealed the antitumor potential of immunomodulatory antibodies targeting MICA/B and NKG2A.
30906652 | Immune evasion by TGFbeta-induced miR-183 repression of MICA/B expression in human lung tumor cells. Immune escape is a hallmark of cancer. In human lung cancer, we have identified a unique microRNA (miR)-based pathway employed by tumor cells to repress detection by immune cells via the NKG2D-MICA/B receptor-ligand system. MICA/B is readily induced by cell transformation and serves as a danger signal and ligand to alert NK and activated CD8+ T cells. However, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that human lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma specimens express little MICA/B while high levels of miR-183 were detected in both tumor types in a TCGA database. Human lung tumor cell lines confirmed the reverse relationship in expression of MICA/B and miR-183. Importantly, a miR-183 binding site was identified on the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of both MICA and MICB, suggesting its role in MICA/B regulation. Luciferase reporter constructs bearing the 3'UTR of MICA or MICB in 293 cells supported the function of miR-183 in repressing MICA/B expression. Additionally, anti-sense miR-183 transfection into H1355 or H1299 tumor cells caused the upregulation of MICA/B. Abundant miR-183 expression in tumor cells was traced to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta), as evidenced by antisense TGFbeta transfection into H1355 or H1299 tumor cells which subsequently lost miR-183 expression accompanied by MICA/B upregulation. Most significantly, anti-sense miR-183 transfected tumor cells became more sensitive to lysis by activated CD8+ T cells that express high levels of NKG2D. Thus, high miR-183 triggered by TGFbeta expressed in lung tumor cells can target MICA/B expression to circumvent detection by NKG2D on immune cells.
31354215 | Immune signature profiling identified prognostic factors for gastric cancer. OBJECTIVE: Tumor microenvironment, especially the host immune system, plays a pivotal role in tumor initiation and progression. Profiling of immune signature within tumor might uncover biomarkers for targeted therapies and clinical outcomes. However, systematic analysis of immune-related genes in gastric cancer (GC) has not been reported. METHODS: Expressions of a total of 718 immune-related genes were generated in 372 stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database using RNA-sequencing data. Integrated bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors as well. RESULTS: Survival analyses revealed 73 genes, which were significantly associated with patient's overall survival (OS). Taken together with clinicopathological parameters, we established a predictive model, containing 10 immune-related genes, which were NRP1, C6, CXCR4, LBP, PNMA1, TLR5, ITGA6, MICB, PBK and TNFRSF18, with powerful efficiency in distinguishing satisfactory or poor survival of STAD patients. Moreover, the top 3 ranked prognostic genes, NRP1, TGFbeta2 and MFGE8, were also significantly associated with patient's OS by an independent validation achieved from Kaplan-Meier plotter database. CONCLUSIONS: We profiled prognostic immune signature and established prognostic predictive model for GC, which could reflect immune disorders within tumor microenvironment, and also may provide novel predictive and therapeutic targets for GC patients in the near future.
31877315 | NKG2D Defines a Subset of Skin Effector Memory CD8 T Cells with Proinflammatory Functions in Vitiligo. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease that results from the loss of melanocytes, associated with skin infiltration of CD8+ effector memory T cells with a Tc1 skewed immune response. NKG2D is an activating receptor found on immune cells, in particular natural killer and activated CD8+ T cells, that are able to produce a high amount of IFN-gamma. Here we found that NKG2D expression was increased in vitiligo skin CD8+ effector memory T cells and was promoted by IL-15. Phenotypic and functional analyses showed that NKG2D+ CD8+ skin effector memory T cells displayed an activated phenotype and produced elevated levels of both IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Additional experiments revealed that vitiligo skin dendritic cells expressed the NKG2D ligands MICA-MICB, and in vitro experiments showed that these ligands could be induced on dendritic cells by IFN-alpha. Cultures of IFN-alpha-stimulated dendritic cells with skin NKG2D+ CD8+ T cells potentiated the production of type 1 cytokines, which was next inhibited by blocking the NKG2D/MICA-MICB interaction. These data show that NKG2D is a potential marker of pathogenic skin CD8+ effector memory T cells during vitiligo. Therefore, targeting NKG2D could be an attractive strategy in vitiligo, a disease for which there is a strong need of innovative treatments.
32514324 | Roles of cytotoxic lymphocytes and MIC/LILR families in pathophysiology of Takayasu arteritis. Takayasu arteritis (TAK) affects the aorta and its primary branches, mainly in young women. In its advanced stages, it can cause severe complications, such as cerebral infarction, impaired vision, and valvular heart diseases. In the aortic tissue of TAK, there is increased infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+T cells, and enhanced expression of accessory molecules, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and MHC class I chain-related gene (MIC) family. Genome-wide association studies on TAK have identified susceptibility genes, such as IL-12p40, MICA, MICB, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor A3 (LILRA3), and LILRB3. Other studies have also shown their involvement in the pathophysiology of TAK. In addition, we reported the importance of NK cells by enhancer enrichment analysis. These results suggest that the gene polymorphisms that potentially upregulate the expression of cytokines and accessory molecules, which contribute to the activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, are associated with the development of TAK. Based on these results, new molecular targeted therapies look promising.
33794208 | Genetic variation in cervical preinvasive and invasive disease: a genome-wide association study. BACKGROUND: Most uterine cervical high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are transient, with only a small fraction developing into cervical cancer. Family aggregation studies and heritability estimates suggest a significant inherited genetic component. Candidate gene studies and previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) report associations between the HLA region and cervical cancer. Adopting a genome-wide approach, we aimed to compare genetic variation in women with invasive cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 with that in healthy controls. METHODS: We did a GWAS in a cohort of unrelated European individuals using data from UK Biobank, a population-based cohort including 273 377 women aged 40-69 years at recruitment between March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010. We used an additive univariate logistic regression model to analyse genetic variants associated with invasive cervical cancer or CIN3. We sought replication of candidate associations in FinnGen, a large independent dataset of 128 123 individuals. We also did a two-sample mendelian randomisation approach to explore the role of risk factors in the genetic risk of cervical cancer. FINDINGS: We included 4769 CIN3 and invasive cervical cancer case samples and 145 545 control samples in the GWAS. Of 9 600 464 assayed and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), six independent variants were associated with CIN3 and invasive cervical cancer. These included novel loci rs10175462 (PAX8; odds ratio [OR] 0 87, 95% CI 0 84-0 91; p=1 07 x 10-9) and rs27069 (CLPTM1L; 0 88, 0 84-0 92; p=2 51 x 10-9), and previously reported signals at rs9272050 (HLA-DQA1; 1 27, 1 21-1 32; p=2 51 x 10-28), rs6938453 (MICA; 0 79, 0 75-0 83; p=1 97 x 10-17), rs55986091 (HLA-DQB1; 0 66, 0 60-0 72; p=6 42 x 10-28), and rs9266183 (HLA-B; 0 73, 0 64-0 83; p=1 53 x 10-6). Three SNPs were replicated in the independent Finnish dataset of 1648 invasive cervical cancer cases: PAX8 (rs10175462; p=0 015), CLPTM1L (rs27069; p=2 54 x 10-7), and HLA-DQA1 (rs9272050; p=7 90 x 10-8). Mendelian randomisation further supported the complementary role of smoking (OR 2 46, 95% CI 1 64-3 69), older age at first pregnancy (0 80, 0 68-0 95), and number of sexual partners (1 95, 1 44-2 63) in the risk of developing cervical cancer. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide new evidence for the genetic susceptibility to cervical cancer, specifically the PAX8, CLPTM1L, and HLA genes, suggesting disruption in apoptotic and immune function pathways. Future studies integrating host and viral, genetic, and epigenetic variation, could further elucidate complex host-viral interactions.

33966912 | Distribution of MICA alleles and haplotypes associated with HLA-B in Greek population. INTRODUCTION: The Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I-related chain A gene (MICA) is a highly polymorphic functional gene located close to the HLA-B locus. Certain MICA alleles have been related to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases while MICA antibodies have been implicated in organ allograft rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the frequencies of MICA alleles and MICA ~ HLA-B haplotypes in the Greek population since, as far as we know, these data are still limited. METHODS: DNA was obtained from 277 unrelated healthy Greek individuals of Caucasian origin, volunteer donors of blood stem cells. HLA-B* and MICA* genotyping was performed by reverse PCR-SSOP. RESULTS: A total of 18 MICA alleles were defined in the present study. The five most frequent alleles in the Greek population were MICA*008 (24.6%), MICA*009 (22.36%), MICA*018 (16.03%), MICA*002 (8.02%) and MICA*004 (7.17%) which altogether account for 77.8% of all alleles. The most common MICA ~ HLA-B haplotypes were MICA*018 ~ B*18 (12.5%) and MICA*009 ~ B*51(11.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The five most frequent MICA alleles in the Greek population were *008, *009, *018, *002, *004. In other Caucasian populations, two of these alleles (*008, and *004) were observed in similar frequencies. MICA*002 was observed less frequently (8.02%) in the Greek population compared to other Caucasian groups (frequencies > 15%). Also, MICA*009 and MICA*018 had elevated frequencies (above 15%) whereas in other Caucasian populations they were found around 10% or less. These data may be important for the elucidation of the role that MICA polymorphisms play in organ and stem cell transplantation and to identify the relation of certain MICA with susceptibility to specific diseases.
34169791 | Allele frequency spectrum of known ankylosing spondylitis associated variants in a Swedish population. Objective: The genetic predisposition to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) has been most widely studied in cohorts with European ancestry. However, within Europe, disease prevalence is higher in Sweden. Given this, we aimed to characterize known AS susceptibility variants in a homogeneous Swedish data set, assessing reproducibility and direction of effect.Method: The power to detect association within an existing Swedish targeted sequencing study (381 controls; 310 AS cases) was examined, and a set of published associations (n = 151) was intersected with available genotypes. Association to disease was calculated using logistic regression accounting for population structure, and HLA-B27 status was determined with direct polymerase chain reaction genotyping.Results: The cases were found to be 92.3% HLA-B27 positive, with the data set showing >= 80% predictive power to replicate associations, with odds ratios >= 1.6 over a range of allele frequencies (0.1-0.7). Thirty-four markers, representing 23 gene loci, were available for investigation. The replicated variants tagged MICA and IL23R loci (p < 1.47 x 10-3), with variable direction of effect noted for gene loci IL1R1 and MST1.Conclusion: The Swedish data set successfully replicated both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC loci, and revealed a different replication pattern compared to discovery data sets. This was possibly due to population demographics, including HLA-B27 frequency and measured comorbidities.
34394116 | Leveraging NKG2D Ligands in Immuno-Oncology. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) revolutionized the field of immuno-oncology and opened new avenues towards the development of novel assets to achieve durable immune control of cancer. Yet, the presence of tumor immune evasion mechanisms represents a challenge for the development of efficient treatment options. Therefore, combination therapies are taking the center of the stage in immuno-oncology. Such combination therapies should boost anti-tumor immune responses and/or target tumor immune escape mechanisms, especially those created by major players in the tumor microenvironment (TME) such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Natural killer (NK) cells were recently positioned at the forefront of many immunotherapy strategies, and several new approaches are being designed to fully exploit NK cell antitumor potential. One of the most relevant NK cell-activating receptors is NKG2D, a receptor that recognizes 8 different NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), including MICA and MICB. MICA and MICB are poorly expressed on normal cells but become upregulated on the surface of damaged, transformed or infected cells as a result of post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms and intracellular pathways. Their engagement of NKG2D triggers NK cell effector functions. Also, MICA/B are polymorphic and such polymorphism affects functional responses through regulation of their cell-surface expression, intracellular trafficking, shedding of soluble immunosuppressive isoforms, or the affinity of NKG2D interaction. Although immunotherapeutic approaches that target the NKG2D-NKG2DL axis are under investigation, several tumor immune escape mechanisms account for reduced cell surface expression of NKG2DL and contribute to tumor immune escape. Also, NKG2DL polymorphism determines functional NKG2D-dependent responses, thus representing an additional challenge for leveraging NKG2DL in immuno-oncology. In this review, we discuss strategies to boost MICA/B expression and/or inhibit their shedding and propose that combination strategies that target MICA/B with antibodies and strategies aimed at promoting their upregulation on tumor cells or at reprograming TAM into pro-inflammatory macrophages and remodeling of the TME, emerge as frontrunners in immuno-oncology because they may unleash the antitumor effector functions of NK cells and cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL). Pursuing several of these pipelines might lead to innovative modalities of immunotherapy for the treatment of a wide range of cancer patients.
34489964 | MICA and KIR: Immunogenetic Factors Influencing Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction and Digestive Clinical Form of Chronic Chagas Disease. Tissue damage observed in the clinical forms of chronic symptomatic Chagas disease seems to have a close relationship with the intensity of the inflammatory process. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the MICA (MHC class I-related chain A) and KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors) polymorphisms are associated with the cardiac and digestive clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease. Possible influence of these genes polymorphisms on the left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in patients with chronic Chagas heart disease was also evaluated. This study enrolled 185 patients with positive serology for Trypanosoma cruzi classified according to the clinical form of the disease: cardiac (n=107) and digestive (n=78). Subsequently, patients with the cardiac form of the disease were sub-classified as with LVSD (n=52) and without LVSD (n=55). A control group was formed of 110 healthy individuals. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP). Statistical analyzes were carried out using the Chi-square test and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was also calculated to evaluate the risk association. MICA-129 allele with high affinity for the NKG2D receptor was associated to the LVSD in patients with CCHD. The haplotype MICA*008~HLA-C*06 and the KIR2DS2-/KIR2DL2-/KIR2DL3+/C1+ combination were associated to the digestive clinical form of the disease. Our data showed that the MICA and KIR polymorphisms may exert a role in the LVSD of cardiac patients, and in digestive form of Chagas disease.
34660145 | Tofacitinib Treatment in Patients With Active COVID-19 Infection. Alopecia areata is a chronic autoimmune disorder attacking the hair follicle epithelium; hence, causing non-scarring hair loss. It has been found that Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) hyperactivity plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Tofacitinib is an effective JAK1 and JAK3 inhibitor that can block several cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, and IL-6. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of oral tofacitinib in hair regrowth in alopecia areata patients. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, it has been advised to withhold JAK inhibitors during the period of active infection due to possible immunosuppression. We herein report two cases of patients with alopecia universalis who continued to use tofacitinib during their active COVID-19 infection and showed no deterioration in their course of illness.
35612169 | Implementing SNOMED CT in Open Software Solutions to Enhance the Findability of COVID-19 Questionnaires. SNOMED CT fosters interoperability in healthcare and research. This use case implemented SNOMED CT for browsing COVID-19 questionnaires in the open-software solutions OPAL/MICA. We implemented a test server requiring files in a given YAML format for implementation of taxonomies with only two levels of hierarchy. Within this format, neither the implementation of SNOMED CT hierarchies and post-coordination nor the use of release files were possible. To solve this, Python scripts were written to integrate the required SNOMED CT concepts (Fully Specified Name, FSN and SNOMED CT Identifier, SCTID) into the YAML format (YAML Mode). Mappings of SNOMED CT to data items of the questionnaires had to be provided as Excel files for implementation into Opal/MICA and further Python scripts were established within the Excel Mode. Finally, a total of eight questionnaires containing 1.178 data items were successfully mapped to SNOMED CT and implemented in OPAL/MICA. This use case showed that implementing SNOMED CT for browsing COVID-19 questionnaires is feasible despite software solutions not supporting SNOMED CT. However, limitations of not being able to implement SNOMED CT release files and its provided hierarchy and post-coordination still have to be overcome.
35878738 | Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors in the treatment of neoplastic and inflammatory disorders. The Janus kinase (JAK) family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases consists of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (Tyrosine Kinase 2). Each of these proteins contains a JAK homology pseudokinase (JH2) domain that interacts with and regulates the activity of the adjacent protein kinase domain (JH1). The Janus kinase family is regulated by numerous cytokines including interferons, interleukins, and hormones such as erythropoietin and thrombopoietin. Ligand binding to cytokine receptors leads to the activation of associated Janus kinases, which then catalyze the phosphorylation of the receptors. The SH2 domain of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) binds to the cytokine receptor phosphotyrosines thereby promoting STAT phosphorylation and activation by the Janus kinases. STAT dimers are then translocated into the nucleus where they participate in the regulation and expression of dozens of proteins. JAK1/3 signaling participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders while JAK1/2 signaling contributes to the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms as well as several malignancies including leukemias and lymphomas. An activating JAK2 V617F mutation occurs in 95% of people with polycythemia vera and about 50% of cases of myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia. Abrocitinib, ruxolitinib, and upadacitinib are JAK inhibitors that are FDA-approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Baricitinib is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and covid 19. Tofacitinib and upadacitinib are JAK antagonists that are used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Additionally, ruxolitinib is approved for the treatment of polycythemia vera while fedratinib, pacritinib, and ruxolitinib are approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis.
35987173 | Sex-specific analysis in Behcet's disease reveals higher genetic risk in male patients. OBJECTIVES: Behcet's disease tends to be more severe in men than women. This study was undertaken to investigate sex-specific genetic effects in Behcet's disease. METHODS: A total of 1762 male and 1216 female patients with Behcet's disease from six diverse populations were studied, with the majority of patients of Turkish origin. Genotyping was performed using an Infinium ImmunoArray-24 BeadChip, or extracted from available genotyping data. Following imputation and extensive quality control measures, genome-wide association analysis was performed comparing male to female patients in the Turkish cohort, followed by a meta-analysis of significant results in all six populations. In addition, a weighted genetic risk score for Behcet's disease was calculated and compared between male and female patients. RESULTS: Genetic association analysis comparing male to female patients with Behcet's disease from Turkey revealed an association with male sex in HLA-B/MICA within the HLA region with a GWAS level of significance (rs2848712, OR = 1.46, P = 1.22 x 10-8). Meta-analysis of the effect in rs2848712 across six populations confirmed these results. Genetic risk score for Behcet's disease was significantly higher in male compared to female patients from Turkey. Higher genetic risk for Behcet's disease was observed in male patients in HLA-B/MICA (rs116799036, OR = 1.45, P = 1.95 x 10-8), HLA-C (rs12525170, OR = 1.46, P = 5.66 x 10-7), and KLRC4 (rs2617170, OR = 1.20, P = 0.019). In contrast, IFNGR1 (rs4896243, OR = 0.86, P = 0.011) was shown to confer higher genetic risk in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Male patients with Behcet's disease are characterized by higher genetic risk compared to female patients. This genetic difference, primarily derived from our Turkish cohort, is largely explained by risk within the HLA region. These data suggest that genetic factors might contribute to differences in disease presentation between men and women with Behcet's disease.
36252553 | JAK: Not Just Another Kinase. The JAK/STAT axis is implicated in cancer, inflammation, and immunity. Numerous cytokines/growth factors affect JAK/STAT signaling. JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) noncovalently associate with cytokine receptors, mediate receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and recruit >=1 STAT proteins (STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b, and STAT6). Tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs dimerize and are then transported into the nucleus to function as transcription factors. Signaling is attenuated by specific suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins, creating a negative feedback loop. Both germline mutations and polymorphisms of JAK family members correlate with specific diseases: Systemic lupus erythematosus (TYK2 polymorphisms); severe combined immunodeficiency (JAK3 mutations); pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TYK2 mutations); and hereditary thrombocytosis (JAK2 mutations). Somatic gain-of-function JAK mutations mainly occur in hematologic malignancies, with the activating JAK2 V617F being a myeloproliferative disorder hallmark; it is also seen in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential. Several T-cell malignancies, as well as B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia also harbor JAK family somatic alterations. On the other hand, JAK2 copy-number loss is associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance. JAK inhibitors (jakinibs) have been deployed in many conditions with JAK activation; they are approved in myeloproliferative disorders, rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, graft-versus-host disease, alopecia areata, ankylosing spondylitis, and in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Clinical trials are investigating jakinibs in multiple other autoimmune/inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, dermatologic and neurologic improvements have been observed in children with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (a genetic interferonopathy) treated with JAK inhibitors.
