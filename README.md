biopatternsg is a system that builds gene regulatory networks, from a basic collection of biological objects, gathering and processing PubMed abstracts and other Internet available informational resources like Mesh, GeneOntology, UniProt, PDB and others, and that uses java and logical engines, like prolog, to integrate and analyse them.

Please, see the wiki for details about the installation of the system and the user's guide.
