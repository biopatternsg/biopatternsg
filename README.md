BioPatternsg is a system that builts gene regulatory networks from a basic collection of biological objects, gathering and processing PubMed abstracts, using Internet available informational resources like Jaspar, HGNC, Mesh, GeneOntology, UniProt and PDB, and that uses the Logical AI based in Prolog, and generative AI models accesible from the NCBI's PubTator service, to model, integrate and analyse them.
