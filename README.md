<!--
**biopatternsg/biopatternsg** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

This is an system that builts gene regulatory networks from a basic collection of biological objects, gathering and processing PubMed abstracts, using Internet available informational resources like Mesh, GeneOntology, UniProt, PDB and others, and that uses logical engines, prolog and java code to integrate and analyse them.
